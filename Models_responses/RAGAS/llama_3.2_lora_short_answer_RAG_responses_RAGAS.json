In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 3:\n|                           | Steering mode, the        |           |\n|                           | Steering mode indicator   |           |\n|                           | and the Threshold values. |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering Functionality    | Indicates the applicable  | Optional  |\n|                           | traffic steering          |           |\n|                           | functionality.            |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)     | Indicates the UL and/or   | Optional  |\n|                           | DL traffic distribution   |           |\n|                           | rules between the 3GPP    |           |\n|                           | and Non-3GPP accesses     |           |\n|                           | together with associated  |           |\n|                           | parameters (when          |           |\n|                           | applicable) for the       |           |\n|                           | traffic matching the      |           |\n|                           | service data flow.        |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode indicator   | Indicates either          | Optional  |\n|                           | autonomous load-balance   |           |\n|                           | operation or              |           |\n|                           | UE-assistance operation,  |           |\n|                           | if the steering mode is   |           |\n|                           | set to                    |           |\n|                           | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".      |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Threshold values          | Indicates the threshold   | Optional  |\n|                           | value(s) for maximum RTT  |           |\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.2.2 High-level Description  \nThis steering mode, called Autonomous steering mode, provides to both\nthe UE and the UPF flexibility on the traffic splitting control in order\nto maximize the bandwidth/throughput when two accesses are applicable\nfor this traffic. For example, some traffic has high bandwidth\nrequirement, such as video service, download service, etc, the higher\nbandwidth/throughput is provided by the network, the better service\nquality can be achieved. Then the autonomous steering mode can be\napplied on these traffic for UE and UPF to flexibly adjust the weight\nfactor on both accesses in order to maximize the bandwidth/throughput.\nAdditionally, this Autonomous steering mode should only be allowed by\nthe operator when both accesses can be applied to transport the traffic,\nand from the operator point of view, high bandwidth/throughput is more\nimportant than the control on the access selection for the traffic\nsteering/switching/splitting. See Figure 6.2.2-1 for details, where one\nsingle packet flow is shown as an example for UL and DL respectively.\nThe weight factor for the traffic over each access, e.g. 30% for UL and\n50% for DL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP\naccess, as shown in the figure, is decided by the UE and the UPF\nindependently for both UL and DL, subject to link status to achieve the\nhigh bandwidth/throughput. As the weight factor for each access can be\nadjusted dynamically by the UE and the UPF, there is no need for the\nPCF/SMF to send the static weight factor values to the UE and the UPF.  \nNOTE1: It can also be considered to send the initial weight factor to\nthe UE and the UPF from the PCF/SMF. This initial value is applied at\nthe beginning of the traffic steering when the link status measurement\nhas not been started.  \nFigure 6.2.2-1: Autonomous steering mode  \nOptionally, the threshold can also be provided together with the\nAutonomous steering mode, including Maximum RTT, UL/DL Maximum Packet\n\nInformation 5:\napplicable to non-GBR SDF;  \nC\\) load balancing, the UE steers the SDF across both the 3GPP access\nand the non-3GPP access with a given precentage if both accesses are\navailable. If there is only one access available, the UE steers the SDF\nby using the available access. This steering mode is only applicable to\nnon-GBR SDF;  \nD\\) priority based, the UE steers the SDF over the access with high\npriority unless the access with high priority is congested or\nunavailable, when the UE steers the SDF over both the access with high\npriority and the access with low priority. This steering mode is only\napplicable to non-GBR SDF;or  \nE\\) redundant, the UE duplicates the traffic of an SDF on both the 3GPP\naccess and the non-3GPP access according to the following rules when\nthere is no threshold values provided in the the access selection\ndescriptor:  \n\\- if both accesses are available and the steering mode information\nfield in the access selection descriptor is set to \\\"Primary access is\nnot provided\\\", the UE shall duplicate all the traffic of the SDF on\nboth accesses;  \n\\- if both accesses are available and the steering mode information\nfield in the access selection descriptor is set to \\\"Primary access is\n3GPP\\\" or set to \\\"Primary access is non-3GPP\\\", the UE shall send all\nthe traffic of an SDF on the indicated primary access (3GPP access or\nnon-GPP access) and may dublicate the traffic on the other access, where\nhow many and which data packets are duplicated by UE on the other access\nare implementation dependent; or  \n\\- If there is only one access available, the UE shall send the traffic\nof the SDF on the available access.  \nThe redundant steering mode is applicable to both GBR SDF and non-GBR\nSDF when there is no threshold value provided in the access selection\ndescriptor. If threshold value is provided in the access selection\ndescriptor, the redundant steering mode is applicable to only non-GBR\nSDF.

Media\ncapture equipment will be connected via cabling by default, commonly\ncoaxial cabling, optical fiber, or Gigabit-Ethernet. Where it is more\nconvenient and feasible, some of the capture equipment can be connected\nwirelessly, using FLUS as foreseen in the present use case. Wireless\nconnections offer the possibility to give spectacular vantage positions\nfor the coverage, from places not easily accessible via cabling, or for\nmore flexible and rapid mobile coverage, for example from a\nshoulder-mounted camera, from a participant wearing a body-mounted\ncamera, or from mobile unmanned vehicles like drones. The minimalistic\nmedia production use case consists of a single remote camera feed that\nuplinks content via FLUS, which corresponds to the breaking news\nreporter use case above.  \nThe media production use case calls for the highest possible quality of\naudio and video content that is delivered via FLUS, but not at the\nsacrifice of reliability of delivery. For example, video content is\npreferably only lightly compressed, including only intra-frame coding.\nThis allows the most flexibility and preservation of quality with\nsubsequent production operations, for example mixing and editing.\nHowever, for practical purposes, the media production use case could\nhave several production levels available -- highly compressed, lightly\ncompressed, uncompressed. Several media formats could be defined within\neach of these production levels.  \nIn some production situations, it is necessary for the production centre\nto communicate in real time with camera personnel, to execute direction\nfor the coverage. Communication can be individually to each FLUS Source,\nand/or among all participants, both at the production centre and among\n\nInformation 4:\nrelating to media streaming should be coordinated by SA4 with SA2 and\nCT3 in the production of the associated stage 2 and stage 3\nspecifications of *Naf\\_EventExposure* services.  \n5.9 Per-application-authorization\n---------------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\nrelating to media streaming should be coordinated by SA4 with SA2 and\nCT3 in the production of the associated stage 2 and stage 3\nspecifications of *Naf\\_EventExposure* services.  \n5.9 Per-application-authorization\n---------------------------------\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Media Streaming AF Event Exposure work item?

        "answer": "option 3: To enable the UE and UPF to freely select split percentages for each access type",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nintroduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a\nsteering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and\ndownlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP\naccesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering Functionality   | Indicates the applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | traffic steering         |             |\n|                          | functionality.           |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)    | Indicates the UL and/or  | Optional    |\n|                          | DL traffic distribution  |             |\n|                          | rules between the 3GPP   |             |\n|                          | and Non-3GPP accesses    |             |\n|                          | together with associated |             |\n|                          | parameters (when         |             |\n|                          | applicable) for the      |             |\n|                          | traffic matching the     |             |\n|                          | service data flow.       |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode indicator  | Indicates either         | Optional    |\n|                          | autonomous load-balance  |             |\n|                          | operation or             |             |\n|                          | UE-assistance operation, |             |\n|                          | if the steering mode is  |             |\n|                          | set to                   |             |\n|                          | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".     |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Threshold value(s)       | Indicates, as applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | for the steering mode,   |             |\n|                          | the threshold value(s)   |             |\n|                          | for maximum RTT or       |             |\n|                          | maximum Packet Loss      |             |\n\nInformation 3:\n1\\) For the Load-Balancing steering mode:  \n\\- The network may not provide pre-defined split percentages, in which\ncase the UE and the UPF can freely and independently decide how to split\nthe traffic across the two accesses.  \nNOTE1: The above bullet covers the \\\"autonomous\\\" steering mode defined\nin Solution \\#2.

For example, if the Rel-16\nload-balancing weight factors are set to fixed rates 50% and 50% per\neach access for UL, and in the case the transport bandwidth is different\nbetween 3GPP and non3GPP, e.g. 50Mbps over 3GPP, and 100Mbps over\nnon3GPP, the UE cannot fully take advantage of 100Mbps via non 3GPP\naccess as not satisfying the fixed 50% and 50% weight factors\nrequirement.  \n2\\) Thresholds:  \nThresholds provided to the UPF may be a useful addition as proposed in\nSolution \\#2/\\#3:  \n\\- Sol\\#3 suggest that PCF provides thresholds in PCC rules and that\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of load-balancing steering mode enhancements?

        "answer": "option 5: By dividing UEs into multiple subgroups",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n860247       **Perf. part: UE power saving enhancements for NR**   NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh-Perf   R4   RP-212630       MediaTek  \nSummary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.  \nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of\nexperienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power\nconsumption. UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the\nsuccess of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to\naddress outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power\nconsumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption\nwith traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the\nfollowing new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:  \n\u2022 Enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging\nenhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive\nmode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in\nconnected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs  \n\u2022 Enhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH\nmonitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG)\nswitching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM\nand/or BFD in connected mode  \n**[Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in\nidle/inactive mode]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the\ngroup of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple\nsubgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for\npaging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via\nassociated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging\nprobability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption\nin idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to\nmonitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall\nmonitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n\nInformation 2:\n### 7.8.5 Analysis of specification impacts  \nFor specification impacts from each UE complexity reduction technique,\nrefer to clauses 7.2 through 7.7.  \n8 UE power saving features\n==========================  \n8.1 Introduction to UE power saving features\n--------------------------------------------  \nThe following UE power saving techniques have been studied:  \n\\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE\nlimits  \n\\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle  \n\\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices  \nThe outcomes of the studies of these techniques are captured in clauses\n8.2 through 8.4, respectively, and summarized in clause 13.  \nIn addition, RAN2 has studied the impact of introducing RedCap UEs on UE\npower consumption in general and has observed that power consumption of\nRedCap UEs may be impacted because of paging false alarm and unnecessary\nSIB1 reading. Paging false alarm and unnecessary SIB1 reading are not\nspecific to RedCap UEs and are discussed in Rel-17 Power Saving WI.\nEnhancements introduced by Rel-17 Power Saving WI should also be\napplicable to RedCap UEs.  \n8.2 Reduced PDCCH monitoring\n----------------------------\n\nInformation 3:\na factor of total PO number associated with up to two paging frames\n(PFs).  \n\u2022 The time location of PEI-O for UE\\'s PO is determined by a reference\npoint and a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the start of\nthe first PDCCH monitoring occasion of this PEI-O. The reference point\nis the start of a reference frame determined by a frame-level offset\nfrom the start of the first PF of the PF(s) associated with the PEI-O.\nThe time location of PEI-O can be configured so that total UE reception\npower consumption in idle/inactive mode, including synchronization and\nRRM measurements, can be minimized.  \n**[Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected\nmode to idle/inactive-mode UEs]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to synchronization for\npaging receptions, RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive\nUE(s) can be provided via system information (SIB17). By exploiting TRS\nfor synchronization, UE can reduce the number of wake-up for SSB before\na paging reception and potentially achieve longer sleep. It is noticed\nthat RS configuration in SIB17 does not affect the UE behaviour in\nCONNECTED mode and can be ignored by UE in CONNECTED mode.  \nThe maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is\n64. If a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability\nindication is always enabled based on that configuration. A UE which\nacquired SIB17 with a TRS configuration but did not yet receive an\nassociated L1-based availability indication considers the configured TRS\nas unavailable. The L1 availability indication is carried in a DCI\nformat 2\\_7, if configured, and a DCI format 1\\_0 with CRC scrambled by\nP-RNTI. The TRS availability indication field in the DCI format(s)\nprovides a bitmap for up to 6 groups of TRS resource sets where the\nconfiguration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit\nof the bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a validity duration\n\nInformation 4:\nthe UE does not need to follow shorter RAN or default paging cycle, and\ntherefore has the same pros/cons: it enables a mix of smartphones and\nRedCap UEs in the network, with an appropriate paging cycle configured\nfor each of them. However, these solutions (solution 1 and eDRX with\n2.56 seconds cycle) assume such RedCap UEs do not need to monitor gNB\nconfigured default broadcasted paging (and UE-specific RAN paging)\ncycles, thus resulting in network not being able to reach such RedCap\nUEs by using default broadcasted paging cycles and/or UE-specific RAN\npaging cycles. This may result e.g. in a potential risk of UE missing SI\nchange indicator. Specifically, solution 1 requires a different way to\ndetermine the UE DRX cycle for RedCap UEs in both the UE and the gNB.  \nSolution 2 is consistent with the LTE solution, but a default\nbroadcasted DRX value of 2.56 seconds is expected not to be widely used,\ne.g. in existing deployments supporting smartphones, requiring changes\nto the paging cycle in existing deployments and configuration of a\nUE-specific paging cycle for each UE intended to follow a shorter paging\ncycle.  \nOther solutions also exist that do not consider the power saving aspects\nfor UEs receiving emergency broadcast services. For example, a simple\nsolution is that RedCap UEs that need to receive emergency broadcast\nservices do not request to be configured with eDRX, and no specific\nhandling/configuration is required for those UEs. However, such RedCap\nUEs do not benefit from any specific eDRX power saving. Alternately, a\nRedCap UE could request an eDRX configuration while still monitoring for\nETWS and CMAS in between the paging occasions.\n\nInformation 5:\nue-Identity) for the UE and ensures the UE is in State 3A according to\n3GPP TS 36.508 \\[7\\] clause 4.5.3A (if the paging fails, switches off\nand on the UE and ensures the UE is in State 3A-RF according to 3GPP TS\n36.508 \\[7\\] clause 7.2A.3); or  \n\\- switches off and on the UE and ensures the UE is in State 3A-RF\naccording to 3GPP TS 36.508 \\[7\\] clause7.2A.3.  \n> 13\\.

One source\nprovides a plot of possible UE battery lifetime against eDRX cycle\nlength. The battery lifetime for a UE with a 2-minute eDRX cycle\ncompared to the same device with 10.24 seconds eDRX cycle is shown to\nresult in between 0.38 -- 340 % improvements for RRC\\_IDLE and 1-419 %\nimprovements for RRC\\_INACTIVE, respectively. The evaluation has been\nperformed for various use cases and inter-arrival times from 100 ms up\nto 5 minutes.  \nFrom RAN2 perspective, extended DRX is beneficial for UE power\nconsumption and can be specified and configured for RedCap UEs so that\neDRX cycles can be used in RRC\\_IDLE and in RRC\\_INACTIVE states.  \nRAN2 sees a benefit extending the eDRX cycle in RRC\\_INACTIVE beyond\n10.24 seconds for RedCap UEs for the following reasons:  \n\\- It is very beneficial to have eDRX cycles \\>10.24 seconds in\nRRC\\_INACTIVE to effectively support the use of Rel-17 SDT (small data\ntransmission) e.g. for use cases with periodic uplink data with\nperiodicity \\> 10.24 seconds. TS 22.104 provides such use cases, e.g.\nsome industrial wireless sensors need to transfer small packets and have\nstrict battery lifetime requirements, while not being sensitive to DL\ntraffic delay.  \n\\- Based on the results in Annex E.1, there is a clear power saving gain\nvs eDRX in RRC\\_IDLE at least for eDRX cycles in the range from 10.24\nseconds up to couple of minutes, where the UE in eDRX in RRC\\_INACTIVE\nadditionally benefits from less signaling. Based on these results,\nlifetime of several years would not be achievable in some cases (e.g.\n\nQuestion: What are the enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving in NR?

The procedure uses an averaging window over a\nspecified time period \\'T\\' such that an average over the given time\nperiod is calculated. This gives a smoothing effect such that clients\nthat need to send one or more large packets, for example for a large I\nframe, have time to compensate for this by sending smaller packets\nafterwards.  \nThe solution defines the time period that is used in somewhat different\nways depending on whether the entity is generating media or whether the\nentity is monitoring the media:  \n\\- Entities generating media, e.g. codecs, should generate packets such\nthat the average bitrate measured over a time period \\'Te\\' that is\nshorter than or equal to T.  \n\\- Entities monitoring the media, e.g. policing functions, should\ncalculate the average bitrate over a time period that \\'Tp\\' that is\nlonger than or equal to T.  \nThe length of the averaging window \\'T\\' is proposed to be 2 seconds for\nMBR calculation (see Annex A).  \nNOTE: It will be determined during the normative phase of the work\nwhether the recommended 2sec averaging window also applies to the GBR.  \nThis solution does not use any signalling between clients and networks,\nor between different networks nodes. This means that the implementation\nis local in the respective node.

One or more\nRAN nodes of the PLMN with Disaster Condition are non-operational.  \n\\- Architecture defined in 3GPPTS23.501\\[4\\] is used as basis\narchitecture for supporting minimization of service interruption.  \n4.2 Architectural Requirements\n------------------------------  \nThe system shall satisfy the stage-1 requirements in TS22.261\\[3\\]\nclause6.31 and TS22.011\\[2\\] clause3.2.2.  \nThe solution shall enable a UE of a selected PLMN (HPLMN or VPLMN) with\nDisaster Condition, to select and register on another PLMN without\nDisaster Condition in UE\\'s forbidden PLMN list when no other PLMN is\navailable except for PLMNs in UE\\'s forbidden PLMN list and the PLMN\nwithout Disaster Condition is able to accept Disaster Inbound Roamers\nfrom the PLMN with Disaster Condition.  \nIf the UE, with HPLMN subscription, was informed by the HPLMN that it\nshould apply Disaster Roaming when a Disaster Condition arises (in the\nHPLMN or a VPLMN), the solution shall enable a UE to detect that a\nDisaster Condition applies to PLMN D, where PLMN D is the UE\\'s HPLMN or\n\nInformation 3:\nterm, if any, in 3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\].  \n**Disaster Condition:** This is the condition that a government decides\nwhether it is applicable or not based on, e.g. a natural disaster or a\nman-made disaster. When this condition applies, users may have the\nopportunity to mitigate service interruptions and failures.  \n**Disaster Roaming:** This is the special type of roaming service that\napplies during a Disaster Condition.  \n**Disaster Inbound Roamers:** Users that (a) cannot get service from the\nPLMN they would normally be served by, due to failure of service during\na Disaster Condition, and (b) are able to register with other PLMNs.  \n3.2 Abbreviations\n-----------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in\n3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in\nthe present document takes precedence over the definition of the same\nabbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\].  \n4 Overview\n==========  \nMobile communication service has become essential part of our society.\nFor example, mobile payment or ride-sharing service cannot work without\nmobile connectivity. Thus, it is important that users of mobile\ncommunication service get their subscribed services without being\ninterrupted.  \nHowever, disasters can cause interruption of communication services,\ne.g.:  \n> \\- Natural disasters such as earthquake can cause fire or power outage\n> to some radio access network equipment. These in turn lead to abrupt\n> disappearance of cells or no routing among radio access network and\n> core network.\n>\n> \\- Human-made disasters such as installation of software with bugs or\n> ill-managed certificate can cause abnormal behaviour of a radio access\n> network. Subscribed UEs of the network cannot exchanges signalling or\n> data.  \nBecause resulting impact on business and society is huge, it is utmost\nimportant to minimize the time and area where connectivity service is\ninterrupted due to disaster.  \n5 Use cases\n===========\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.4.1 Description  \nWhen the UE of a PLMN with Disaster Condition is notified of Disaster\nCondition, according to conclusion of the Key Issue \\#1, and the UE\nselects the other PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service, then the UE\nshall perform the registration procedure in order to be registered to\nthe PLMN. It is unclear how the Disaster Roaming PLMN authenticates the\nUE and how to collect charging information when the Disaster Condition\napplies.  \nAccording to 3GPPTS22.261\\[3\\] clause 6.31.2.3:  \n3GPP system shall be able to collect charging information for a Disaster\nInbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition  \nAccording to 3GPPTS22.261\\[3\\] clause 6.31.2.2:  \nThe 3GPP system shall be able to support provision of service to\nDisaster Inbound Roamer only within the specific region where Disaster\nCondition applies.  \nAs per this service requirement quoted, the Disaster Roaming PLMN shall\nbe able to consider the area of service to Disaster Inbound Roamers that\nis limited to the region where Disaster Condition applies.  \nThe following questions are expected to be studied within this Key\nIssue:  \n\\- How a registration procedure initiated by Inbound Disaster Roamer is\nperformed;  \n\\- How to authenticate Inbound Disaster Roamer during the registration\nprocedure;  \n\\- Which network functions or entities are involved for the registration\nprocedure of Disaster Inbound Roamers;  \n\\- How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound\nDisaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies;  \n\\- How and which function to collect charging information for a Disaster\nInbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition;\nand  \n\\- What other information, if any, is needed to be transferred between\nthe UE and the network during the initial registration procedure.  \n5.5 Key issue \\#5: PLMN selection when a \\\"Disaster Condition\\\" applies\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\n\\[CPR-C-003\\] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a resource\nefficient means for a PLMN to indicate to potential Disaster Inbound\nRoamers whether they can access the PLMN or not.  \n\\[CPR-C-004\\] The Disaster Inbound Roamers shall perform network\nreselection when a Disaster Condition has ended.  \n\\[CPR-D-001\\] The 3GPP system shall minimize congestion caused by\nDisaster Roaming.  \n\\[CPR-E-001\\] The 3GPP system shall be able to collect charging\ninformation for a Disaster Inbound Roamer with information about the\napplied disaster condition.  \n7 Conclusions and Recommendations\n=================================  \nThis document analyses a number of use cases to minimize potential\nservice interruption that may be caused when natural or human-made\ndisaster hits. The resulting potential requirements have been\nconsolidated in clause 6. Additionally, it is recommended to include the\nterminology introduced in this TR to TS 22.261, for aid in expressing\nand understanding the Minimization of Service Interruption requirements  \nIt is recommended that the consolidated potential requirements\nidentified in this TR are considered as the basis of normative\nrequirements in order to better serve the communication services.  \n#########  Annex A: Change history  \n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n| **C   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| hange |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| hist  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| ory** |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n| **D   | *     | **T   | *     | **    | **    | **Su  | **New |\n| ate** | *Meet | Doc** | *CR** | Rev** | Cat** | bject | vers  |\n|       | ing** |       |       |       |       | /Comm | ion** |\n|       |       |       |       |       |       | ent** |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n\nQuestion: What aspects of the Disaster Roaming service are specified in TS 22.011 and TS 22.261?

Both, 5G Media Streaming \\[13\\] and TV Video Profiles \\[3\\]\nbuild on CMAF-based Segment formats and DASH distribution. From 3GPP TS\n26.116, the following operation points may be considered in scope of the\n4K-TV Streaming Scenario (pending availability of appropriate test\ncontent):  \n\\- H.265/HEVC UHD, see 3GPP TS 26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.4.  \n\\- H.265/HEVC UHD HDR, see 3GPP TS 26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.6.  \n\\- H.265/HEVC UHD HDR HLG, see 3GPP TS 26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.8.  \nThis scenario is based on CMAF (including LL-DASH and HLS-LL)\ndistribution of UHD-TV video services over 5G networks to 5G/non-5G\ncapable devices. This includes 5G-equipped devices (e.g. smartphone,\ntablets,...) but also other devices gateway (e.g. TV sets,\nHDMI-Stick...) accessing services through a \"5G-gateway\" which can be a\nmobile phone or a home gateway. As multiple linear services will be\ndelivered in parallel (news, sport, talk show...) in a similar manner as\ntraditional TV services in a multiplex (potentially using\nmulticast/broadcast delivery over 5G). In certain environments, High\nFrame Rate (HFR) beyond 60 fps is considered, e.g. in DVB and ATSC\nbroadcast specifications. 3GPP does not have any HFR TV video profiles\nyet.  \nImportant aspects that are expected to be considered when evaluating a\ncodec in the context of this 4K-TV scenario are:  \n\\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:  \n\\- High and uninterrupted visual quality, considering the service\nconstraints.  \n\\- Any savings can provide significant benefits due to the expected\nlarge volume of the traffic either in quality or network utilization.  \n\\- Adaptive Bitrate streaming:  \n\\- Multiple bit rates are provided, typically with a ladder of 30--50%\nto permit bandwidth adaptation. The use of constant bit rate (CBR)\n\nInformation 2:\n16\\) random access and channel change times comparable to existing HD TV\nservices.  \n17\\) TV service content delivery over broadcast only, unicast only and\ncombinations of the two.  \n18\\) delivery of real-time and non-real-time content.  \n19\\) enable extensibility and forward-compatibility to new requirements,\nformats, codecs and other functions to the extent possible.  \n20\\) ability to transport TV streams formatted not compliant to 3GPP\nstandards.  \n21\\) Ability to access an eMBMS transport session with the support of\nonly transport metadata.  \n22\\) Ability to be initiated by a UE with sufficient metadata provided\nby a mechanism other than User Service Description for non 3GPP\ntransport services.  \n**Based on these requirements, several 3GPP specification have been\nupdated to support different features:**  \n\\- Standardized xMB interface towards the (TV) content provider  \n\\- Unified framework for service type negotiations and agreements with\ncontent providers  \n\\- Enables dynamic service/session establishment  \n\\- Extensible to other types of content and content providers (V2X etc.)  \n\\- Receive-only mode  \n\\- Receive Only mode: enable devices without SIM card or 3GPP\nsubscription  \n\\- Expand the reach of MBMS into traditional TV receivers  \n\\- Enable Free-to-Air content broadcast over MBMS  \n\\- Receive Only mode with independent unicast: enable interactive\nservices feeding off of TV live broadcast  \n\\- Opportunity for more cost-effective data plans for mobile TV (bundled\nplans)  \n\\- Transport-only mode (also referred to in TS 23.746 \\[16\\] as \\\"MBMS\nService Type 1\\\", or \\\"Transport only mode\\\")  \n\\- Provide pass-through MBMS bearer service type  \n\\- Enable TV broadcasters to provide the content via MBMS in the native\nformat without transcoding  \n\\- Simple receiver design  \n\\- Use MBMS network as common delivery platform for different content\ntypes and services  \n\\- Shared MBMS Broadcast  \n\\- Operators can aggregate their MBMS networks into a shared MBMS\n\nInformation 3:\n26.116 as well as the corresponding media decoding capabilities for 5GMS\nin TS 26.511 in order to enable support for up to 8K video.  \nMore specifically, this work item completed the following work:  \n-   Defined new 8K TV operation point(s) for TV Video profiles with\nconforming bitstream requirement based on H.265/HEVC Main-10 Profile\nMain Tier Profile in TS 26.116 \\[1\\]  \n-   Defined the relevant ISO BMFF encapsulation, CMAF media profile and\nDASH signalling for the new 8K TV operation point in TS 26.116\n\\[1\\].  \n-   Included the newly defined decoding capabilities and associated\nprofiles and operation points into 5G Media Streaming for TV\nServices in TS 26.511 \\[2\\].  \n-   Documented typical traffic characteristics of 8K TV video services\n> in TR 26.925 \\[3\\].  \nThe work was carried out in close collaboration with MPEG CMAF and DVB\nto align the media profiles.  \n**References**  \nRelated CRs: set \\\"TSG Status = Approved\\\" in:\n<https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=920011>  \n\\[1\\] TS 26.116, \\\"Virtual Reality (VR) profiles for streaming\napplications\\\"  \n\\[2\\] TS 26.511, \\\"5G Media Streaming (5GMS); Profiles, codecs and\nformats.\\\"  \n\\[3\\] TR 26.925, \\\"Typical traffic characteristics of media services on\n3GPP networks\\\"  \n15.3 5G Video Codec Characteristics\n-----------------------------------  \n------------ ------------------------------------ ----------------- -------- --------------- --------------\n**870011**   **5G Video Codec Characteristics**   **FS\\_5GVideo**   **S4**   **SP-200052**   **Qualcomm**\n------------ ------------------------------------ ----------------- -------- --------------- --------------  \nSummary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220637.  \nThe Technical Report provides a full characterization framework for\nvideo codecs in the context of 5G services.

However, consumption of video services\non fixed receivers (e.g. TV sets) remains a preferable way of\nexperiencing the high-quality content, whether it is for on-demand\n(e.g., blockbuster movies) or live services (e.g., sport events). Recent\nreports from largest VOD platforms such as Netflix confirm that\nassumption and show that the primary way of watching content remains\nfixed TV screens, covering 70% of devices 6 months after subscription\n\\[17\\]. In the same way, YouTube indicates that service usage on fixed\nTV set remains an inevitable way of accessing the content, with 250M of\nhours viewed per day on TV screens \\[18\\]. As 5G media streaming targets\na wide range of connected devices and is expected to be able to deliver\nvideo streams to many compatible high-resolution receivers, (e.g.\n5G-HDMI-sticks, 5G-StB/5G-MediaGateway or even 5G-TV sets) the inclusion\nof 4K TV Scenarios for 5G Video codec evaluation is important.  \nFirst, the 4K-TV set is currently the most established way of displaying\npremium quality services using latest technology improvements for video\ncontent, including High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) and Wide-Colour-Gamut (WCG).\nLatest statistics from the Ultra-HD forum indicate that 148 UHD services\nare currently on-air, 74% being linear, 45% of those using HDR \\[19\\].\nIn addition, a large number of SVOD operators propose 4K access in their\nsubscription packages (e.g. Netflix\u2122 and Amazon Prime\u2122). All these\nservices may eventually take advantage of 5G-network capabilities to\nincrease the device reach and enlarge audiences. This scenario is also\nendorsed by strong shipment forecasts, as indicated in the latest IHS\n4K-TV UHD bluebook \\[20\\].\n\nInformation 5:\n### 5.20.1 Description  \nBroadcast/Multicast services in 5GC (5MBS) are available, potentially\nlimited by a given service area.  \nA user can receive such a service either outdoor or at home.  \nThe MNO wants to keep the benefits of multicast/broadcast distribution\nfor in-home access.

Hence, the same solution can be used\nfor general UEs. However, there is a limitation that only for IP-based\nPDU Session is supported.  \nIn Rel-17, because we are extending the ATSSS interworking for 5G-RG to\ngeneral UEs, it is reasonable to extend supported session types to\nEthernet PDU Session type.

They are grouped into two main categories: (1) Steering\nmode enhancements, and (2) supporting an MA PDU Session with a 3GPP\naccess leg over EPC.  \n**[Steering mode enhancements:]{.underline}**  \n\\- **PMF measurements per QoS flow**: To decide how to steer the traffic\nof a data flow, access network performance measurements may need to be\ntaken, to estimate the RTT and/or the Packet Loss Rate over each of the\naccesses of a MA PDU Session.  \nThe access network performance measurements (which apply the Performance\nMeasurement Function (PMF) protocol) were enhanced to support RTT\nmeasurements and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurements over a certain QoS\nflow (aka access performance measurements per QoS flow).

It is not clear how long the\nmax value of this \\\"gap\\\" can be.  \nBased on above, it is recommended to ask RAN a set of questions and wait\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.2.1 Description  \nPaging Occasions (POs) are calculated based on the UE identifier i.e.\nIMSI and 5G-S-TMSI for EPS and 5GS, respectively. The formulae for\ndetermination of the POs are specified in TS36.304\\[2\\] and\nTS38.304\\[3\\] for E-UTRA and NR, respectively.  \nMulti-USIM device that is unable to simultaneously monitor paging on all\n3GPP RATs and systems in which it is in Idle state or RRC\\_Inactive\nstate (for 5GS) needs to make a choice of the paging channel(s) to\nmonitor which can lead to unsuccessful paging on the other paging\nchannel(s). In some cases the UE identifier values associated with the\ndifferent USIMs can lead to systematic collisions which may result in\ncorresponding missed pages. The present key issue shall study:  \n\\- How the system can enable operation when the paging associated with\nthe 3GPP RATs and systems in which the Multi-USIM device is in Idle\nstate or RRC\\_Inactive state (for 5GS) overlap in time?  \nNOTE1: The exact timing of paging on the radio interface is managed by\nRAN, therefore coordination with the RAN Groups will be necessary.  \n\\- Whether and how the network needs to be aware of specific UE\ncommunication constraints (e.g. Single Rx) in order to enable the\nMulti-USIM device to receive paging for each of the registered USIMs?  \nThe solutions for enabling receiving paging for each of the registered\nUSIMs in 5GS and EPS may not be based on the same principles.  \nNOTE2: For this key issue, coordination with RAN WGs is needed for\nfinal solution decision. No E-UTRA radio interface impact is expected in\nRAN WGs.  \n5.3 Key Issue 3: Coordinated leaving for Multi-USIM device\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.11.2 Functional Description  \nWhen a UE registers and indicates (e.g. in MUSIM Assistance Information)\nthat is behaving as Multi-USIM device, then the Network provides in a\nregistration response message or, in 5GS, at any time in a UE\nconfiguration update message an Upper Bound Timer for paging response\nspecifying that the UE shall provide a response to paging (if paging\nmessage is received) within the time indicated by the timer. This way,\neven if the user missed the request for input from the UE so the UE can\nbe instructed to respond to paging, the UE can autonomously complete the\npaging procedure one way or another by the time indicated by the\nnetwork. The network indicates a timer smaller than the time the network\ngives up paging the UE.  \nNOTE: It could be possible for the operator or user settings to default\nto \\\"respond to paging\\\" if the UE is not busy in other USIMs.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.15.1 Introduction  \nThe solution applies to Key Issue \\#2 \\\"Enabling Paging Reception\\\".  \nThe solution is described for the 5GS but can also be applied to the\nEPS. The solution is suitable for all scenarios, i.e. where the UE is\nconnected to multiple 5GS systems, a mix of 5GS and EPS systems, or only\nmultiple EPS systems.  \nThe solution relies on the following principles:  \n\\- When a UE detects non-optimal paging timing e.g. collision or\nincreased power consumption, the UE may in the Registration Request\nmessage indicate that it would like to use the included Alternative\nUE\\_ID solely to determine PF/PO. The Alternative UE\\_ID has the same\nformat as the UE\\_ID defined in TS36.304\\[2\\] and TS38.304\\[3\\].  \nNOTE: The indication and/or the Alternative UE\\_ID may be included in a\nMUSIM Assistance Information container as there may be other information\nsent not in scope of this particular solution, but for other solutions.  \n\\- The UE\\_ID format for E-UTRA/NR is 10bits and for NB-IoT it is 12bits\nas defined in TS36.304\\[2\\] and TS38.304\\[3\\].  \n\\- The AMF subsequently confirms the proposed Alternative UE\\_ID in the\nRegistration Accept message.  \n\\- The AMF includes the Alternative UE\\_ID, as the UE Identity Index\nValue to be used solely for PF/PO computation, in the N2 paging message\nwhen paging the UE, but the other ID(s) i.e. 5G-S-TMSI, S-TMSI and/or\nIMSI used in the paging message is still included.  \n\\- RAN uses the Alternative UE\\_ID i.e. the received UE Identity Index\nValue to determine the next PF/PO and pages the UE. In this case the RAN\ndoes not derive the UE\\_ID from the IMSI or 5G-S-TMSI.  \n\\- The Alternative UE\\_ID is used for all subsequent PF/PO computations\nuntil the UE either revokes it by not including it in a subsequent\nregistration (e.g. due to mobility or periodic) or provides another\nAlternative UE\\_ID for paging in a registration message. The change\nshould not take effect until the request has been confirmed by the AMF.\n\nQuestion: How does a Multi-USIM UE modify the timing of paging occasions in 5GS?

Network slicing supports the flexible use of\nnetwork resources so that multiple networks customized to the needs of\neach set of applications can be provided simultaneously over the network\nresources while ensuring resource isolation and meeting different SLAs.\nAs more diverse industries start to use the capabilities provided by 5G\nsystem and various new services are implemented over the 5G system, the\nexpected service requirements on the 5G system vary. To meet these\ndiverse requirements on the network, the use of network slices will\nincrease further as 5G system deployments are expanded.  \nWhen configuring network slices within its network, each network\noperator may consider various factors, such as required QoS of the\napplications supported over the network slices, the amount of required\nnetwork resources to support the applications, the expected geographical\nand time boundary where the network slice services need to be provided,\nthe usable and deployed network resources at the location where the\napplications are used, the number of users, the type of devices (e.g.,\nIIoT), etc. After considering these factors, a network operator may\nprovide a network slice for different services to users. Similarly, 3rd\nparties may be authorized by the network operator to configure their own\nnetwork slices based on these various criteria, within the bounds of an\nSLA with the network operator.  \nHowever, the provisioning of network slices can be complicated, such as\nwhen a UE requests the simultaneous use of multiple network slices where\n\nInformation 5:\n### 4.4.1 General  \nNetwork slicing in accordance with 3GPPTS23.501\\[7\\] can be used for\nseveral purposes such as to separate MC service users, UEs as well as\napplications in accordance with the various QoS requirements independent\nfrom 3GPP or non-3GPP access.  \nThe corresponding slice information identifies a network slice across\nthe 5G core, access network and the UE.

The additional functionality that is supported by the UE and\nthe network functions shown in these figures is specified in clause5.32\nbelow. In summary:  \n\\- The UE supports one or more of the steering functionalities specified\nin clause5.32.6, e.g. MPTCP functionality and/or ATSSS-LL\nfunctionality. Each steering functionality in the UE enables traffic\nsteering, switching and splitting across 3GPP access and non-3GPP\naccess, in accordance with the ATSSS rules provided by the network. The\nATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory in the UE for MA PDU Session of type\nEthernet.  \n\\- The UPF may support MPTCP Proxy functionality, which communicates\nwith the MPTCP functionality in the UE by using the MPTCP protocol\n(IETFRFC8684\\[81\\]).  \n\\- The UPF may support ATSSS-LL functionality, which is similar to the\nATSSS-LL functionality defined for the UE. There is no user plane\nprotocol defined between the ATSSS-LL functionality in the UE and the\nATSSS-LL functionality in the UPF. The ATSSS-LL functionality in the UPF\nis not shown in the following three figures.  \nNOTE1: ATSSS-LL functionality is needed in the 5GC for MA PDU Session\nof type Ethernet.  \n\\- In addition, the UPF supports Performance Measurement Functionality\n(PMF), which may be used by the UE to obtain access performance\nmeasurements (see clause5.32.5) over the user-plane of 3GPP access\nand/or over the user-plane of non-3GPP access.  \n\\- The AMF, SMF and PCF are extended with new functionality that is\nfurther discussed in clause5.32.  \nFigure 4.2.10-1: Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout\narchitecture for ATSSS support  \nNOTE2: The interactions between the UE and PCF that may be required for\nATSSS control are specified in TS23.503\\[45\\].  \nNOTE3: A UPF that supports the MPTCP Proxy functionality and the PMF\n\nInformation 3:\nthe 5G System. All traffic mapped to the same 5G QoS Flow receive the\nsame forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue management\npolicy, rate shaping policy, RLC configuration, etc.). Providing\ndifferent QoS forwarding treatment requires separate 5G QoS Flow.  \n**5G QoS Identifier:** A scalar that is used as a reference to a\nspecific QoS forwarding behaviour (e.g. packet loss rate, packet delay\nbudget) to be provided to a 5G QoS Flow. This may be implemented in the\naccess network by the 5QI referencing node specific parameters that\ncontrol the QoS forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission\nthresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer protocol\nconfiguration, etc.).  \n**Access Traffic Steering:** The procedure that selects an access\nnetwork for a new data flow and transfers the traffic of this data flow\nover the selected access network. Access traffic steering is applicable\nbetween one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Access Traffic Switching:** The procedure that moves all traffic of an\nongoing data flow from one access network to another access network in a\nway that maintains the continuity of the data flow. Access traffic\nswitching is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Access Traffic Splitting:** The procedure that splits the traffic of a\ndata flow across multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is\napplied to a data flow, some traffic of the data flow is transferred via\none access and some other traffic of the same data flow is transferred\nvia another access. Access traffic splitting is applicable between one\n3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Application detection filter:** A logic used to detect packets\ngenerated by an application based on extended inspection of these\npackets, e.g., header and/or payload information, as well as dynamics of\npacket flows. The logic is entirely internal to a UPF, and is out of\nscope of this specification.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 4.3.7 Traffic steering control  \nTraffic Steering Control refers to the capability to activate/deactivate\ntraffic steering policies from the PCF in the SMF for the purpose of:  \n\\- steering the subscriber\\'s traffic to appropriate operator 3rd party\nservice functions (e.g. NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS\nprotection) in the N6-LAN or 5G-LAN type of services. This is supported\nin non-roaming and home-routed scenarios only.  \n\\- AF influenced traffic diversion which enables the routing of the user\ntraffic matching the traffic filters provided in the PCC rule to a local\nData Network identified by the DNAI per AF request.

The interaction between network functions is\nrepresented in two ways:  \n\\- A service-based representation, where network functions enable other\nauthorized network functions to access their services. This\nrepresentation also includes point-to-point reference points where\nnecessary;  \n\\- A reference point representation, which shows that interactions exist\nbetween those network functions for which a reference point is depicted\nbetween them.  \n5.2 Reference architecture\n--------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\naccess network by the 5QI referencing node specific parameters that\ncontrol the QoS forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission\nthresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer protocol\nconfiguration, etc.).  \n**5G System:** 3GPP system consisting of 5G Access Network (AN), 5G Core\nNetwork and UE.  \n**5G-BRG:** The 5G-BRG is a 5G-RG defined in BBF.  \n**5G-CRG:** The 5G-CRG is a 5G-RG specified in DOCSIS MULPI\\[89\\].  \n**5G-RG:** A 5G-RG is a RG capable of connecting to 5GC playing the role\nof a UE with regard to the 5G core. It supports secure element and\nexchanges N1 signalling with 5GC. The 5G-RG can be either a 5G-BRG or\n5G-CRG.  \n**Access Traffic Steering:** The procedure that selects an access\nnetwork for a new data flow and transfers the traffic of this data flow\nover the selected access network. Access traffic steering is applicable\nbetween one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Access Traffic Switching:** The procedure that moves all traffic of an\nongoing data flow from one access network to another access network in a\nway that maintains the continuity of the data flow. Access traffic\nswitching is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Access Traffic Splitting:** The procedure that splits the traffic of a\ndata flow across multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is\napplied to a data flow, some traffic of the data flow is transferred via\none access and some other traffic of the same data flow is transferred\nvia another access. Access traffic splitting is applicable between one\n3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Allowed NSSAI***: Indicating the S-NSSAIs values the UE could use in\nthe Serving PLMN in the current Registration* Area.  \n**Allowed Area:** Area where the UE is allowed to initiate communication\nas specified in clause5.3.2.3.  \n**Alternative S-NSSAI:** Indicating a compatible S-NSSAI for an S-NSSAI\nin the Allowed NSSAI that the AMF uses to replace an S-NSSAI when the\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSS) feature in 5G networks?

For the data source, all the data required by NWDAF\nneeds to be generated or prepared accordingly before they are retrieved\nby NWDAF. And for the NWDAF, it needs to distinguish every piece of data\nreceived from different data sources and of data received from the same\ndata source but for different network analytic purposes.  \nThe operator may notice that the data collection is the major task of\none NWDAF instance, therefore, less computation resource can be\nallocated to that NWDAF instance, and more storage and network resources\nmay be allocated if necessary. Or on the extreme cases, a new NWDAF\ninstance needs to be provided or it may be found out that deploying a\nDCCF is the optimum solution. For making a decision, the measurement\ndata is needed, such as how many data is collected by a NWDAF instance\nor by all NWDAF instances related to some areas of interests, so that\nthe operator could have the understanding and estimation of the working\nload and working status of the NWDAF instance.  \nMoreover, it is also beneficial to have the granular measurement of data\ncollection, such as measuring the data collected from different type of\ndata sources. This measurement may provide information about if it is\npossible to optimize the deployment of NWDAF. For example, the NWDAF\ninstance may be geographically deployed closer to its major data source\nto reduce the latency and save network resources.  \nIn the other case, the monitoring of data collection will help improve\nthe other services provided by NWDAF.

Cyber-physical control applications are to be\nunderstood as applications that control physical processes.\nCyber-physical control applications in automation follow certain\nactivity patterns, which are open-loop control, closed-loop control,\nsequence control, and batch control (see Clause 4.2).  \nCommunication services supporting cyber-physical control applications\nneed to be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service\navailability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains?

It is mandatory for a RedCap\nUE to support 20 MHz maximum UE channel bandwidth in FR1 and 100 MHz in\nFR2.\n\nInformation 2:\nsignalling.  \n\\- Option 2: Define a new IE specifically for RedCap UEs containing\nRedCap-specific capabilities. The IE is included in the signalling only\nby Redcap UEs.  \n\\- Option 3: The network identifies RedCap UEs based on identification\nsolution (see Clause 11.1), e.g. during Msg1, Msg3, MsgA, etc, (pending\nRAN1 conclusion). The identification is forwarded it to target gNB\nduring handover.  \n\\- Option 4: The network identifies RedCap UE based on the reported\ncapabilities, assuming the identification can be done through\nRedCap-specific capabilities not used by non-RedCap UEs.  \nFrom RAN2 perspective, the pros and cons to define only one device type\nor multiple device types are:  \nOnly one RedCap UE type:  \nPros:  \n\\- No market fragmentation of \\\"types\\\".  \n\\- Simpler specification, e.g. on early identification, access control,\netc.  \n\\- Avoid non-technical discussion outside 3GPP\\'s scope, e.g. product\nmanagement, similar to the discussions on LTE categories.  \nCons:  \n\\- Cannot provide independent access control for different UE types, if\nthis was deemed necessary.  \nMultiple RedCap UE types:  \nPros:  \n\\- Flexible access control is possible if necessary, e.g. independent\naccess control for different UE types.  \nCons:  \n\\- Potential market fragmentation of \\'types\\' leading to loss of\neconomies of scale and increased device costs.  \n\\- More specification complexity/effort, e.g. on early identification,\naccess control, etc.  \n\\- May lead to non-technical discussion outside 3GPP\\'s scope, e.g.\nproduct management, similar to the discussions on LTE categories.  \nThe need on independent access control for different RedCap UE types is\nnot discussed in the SI phase.  \n10.2 Constraining of reduced capabilities\n-----------------------------------------\n\nInformation 3:\n### 11.2.5 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs  \nThe purpose of the RedCap access restrictions is to eliminate or limit\nthe impact on legacy UEs. The impact for enabling any of above features\nis an increase is in OH due to added parameters in SI broadcast\nsignalling.  \nOne possibility is that separate RACH configuration is provided for\nRedCap UEs. In such case, it would be possible to configure different\nRACH parameters to RedCap and non-RedCap UEs, such as different maximum\nnumber for preamble transmission, different back-off timer after an\nattempt or a different power ramping step for RedCap UEs.\n\nInformation 4:\nEnables RRC connection rejection of RedCap UE for access restriction (for UEs coming from RRC\\_IDLE and RRC\\_INACTIVE if the UE context is not found).                                                                                                       Potential increase in UL OH and complexity in configuration and maintenance of multiple initial UL BWP for the gNB, for the option of configuring separate initial UL BWPs.\nMakes it possible to differentiate or enable prioritization of non-RedCap UEs vs. RedCap UEs during contention resolution if RedCap UE type is visible to MAC layer.                                                                                         The indication mechanisms in this category may be limiting in terms of the number of further sub-types/capabilities within RedCap device type that may be distinguished, if such sub-types/capability indication are introduced.\nIn case of fallback from 2-step to 4-step RACH during MsgA PUSCH failure, possibility for coverage recovery.

Adding the potential gains of this to the above summarized\ngains would indicate that the LTE downlink radio-access concept can\nfulfil the agreed spectrum-efficiency targets.\n\nInformation 3:\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| 3GPP TR 36.717-03-01 V17.0.0     |                                  |\n| (2022-06)                        |                                  |\n+==================================+==================================+\n| Technical Report                 |                                  |\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| 3rd Generation Partnership       |                                  |\n| Project;                         |                                  |\n|                                  |                                  |\n| Technical Specification Group    |                                  |\n| Radio Access Networks;           |                                  |\n|                                  |                                  |\n| LTE inter-band Carrier           |                                  |\n| Aggregation for                  |                                  |\n|                                  |                                  |\n| 3 bands DL with 1 band UL        |                                  |\n|                                  |                                  |\n| (Release 17)                     |                                  |\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n|                                  |                                  |\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n|!                                |![3GPP-logo\\_web](media/image2.p |\n| [5G-logo\\_175px](media/image1.jp | ng){width=\"1.7715277777777778in\" |\n| eg){width=\"1.3243055555555556in\" | height=\"1.0368055555555555in\"}   |\n| height=\"0.9180555555555555in\"}   |                                  |\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n|                                  |                                  |\n\nInformation 4:\n\\[13\\] Contribution to 3GPP TSG RAN meeting \\#45 RP-090744: \\\"TR36.912\nAnnex A3: Self evaluation results\\\".  \n\\[14\\] Contribution to 3GPP TSG RAN meeting \\#45 RP-090745: \\\"TR36.912\nAnnex C1: Updated characteristics template\\\".  \n\\[15\\] Contribution to 3GPP TSG RAN meeting \\#45 RP-090746: \\\"TR36.912\nAnnex C2: Link budget template\\\".  \n\\[16\\] Contribution to 3GPP TSG RAN meeting \\#45 RP-090747: \\\"TR36.912\nAnnex C3: Compliance template\\\".  \n\\[17\\] 3GPP TS 36.133: \\\"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access\n(E-UTRA); Requirements for support of radio resource management\\\".  \n> \\[18\\] 3GPP TR 36.814: \\\" Feasibility study for Further Advancements\n> for E-UTRA (LTE-Advanced)\\\"  \nNote: The RAN meeting contributions referenced above are provided with\nthe present Technical Report.  \n3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations\n========================================  \n3.1 Definitions\n---------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions\ngiven in TR21.905\\[2\\] apply.  \n3.2 Symbols\n-----------  \nVoid  \n3.3 Abbreviations\n-----------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations defined in\nTS21.905 \\[2\\] and the following apply:  \nCoMP Coordinated MultiPoint  \nMBMS Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service  \nMU-MIMO Multi User Multiple Input Multiple Output  \nRIT Radio Interface Technology  \nSON Self Organising Networks  \nSRIT Set of Radio Interface Technologies  \nSU-MIMO Single User Multiple Input Multiple Output  \n4 Introduction\n==============  \nAt the TSG RAN \\#39 meeting, the Study Item description on \\\"Further\nAdvancements for E-UTRA (LTE-Advanced)\\\" was approved \\[1\\].

In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\navailable.

This steering mode is only applicable to\nnon-GBR SDF; or  \nD\\) priority based, the UE steers the SDF over the access with high\npriority unless the access with high priority is congested or\nunavailable, when the UE steers the SDF over both the access with high\npriority and the access with low priority.

The threshold values are only used when the\nsteering mode is indicated as load balancing or priority based.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 6.12.3 Procedures  \nFigure 6.12.3-1 provides an example call flow of how the UE operates\nwith the UE assisted traffic steering mode.  \nFigure 6.12.3-1: UE assisted traffic steering mode operation in case PMF\nis used to assist UPF  \n1\\. The UE and the network establish an MA PDU session as specified in\nClause 5.32.6.1 of TS 23.501. The SMF configures the allowed steering\nmode (e.g. Active-Standby or Smallest Delay) in ATSSS rules as specified\nin Release 16. In addition, the SMF may indicate, for each ATSSS rule,\nif the UE can switch to the UE assisted operation.. The SMF also\nindicates if traffic splitting / load balancing is allowed or not in the\nATSSS/N4 rules pushed to the UE/UPF. A UE that does not support the UE\nassisted operation ignores the indication for this operation in ATSSS\nrules.  \n2\\. The UE monitors UE state (e.g. battery state, temperature) and\nconditions for both 3GPP and non-3GPP access (e.g. power profile). If\nsome conditions (based on UE implementation) are met, the UE invokes the\nUE assisted operation for the traffic associated with one or more of the\nATSSS rules that allow UE assisted operation. It determines the desired\ntraffic split for both uplink and downlink directions. If traffic\nsplitting/ load balancing is not allowed, the UE determines the\npreferred access.  \nNOTE: The details of UE monitoring and determination of desired traffic\nsplit ratios/preferred access in uplink and downlink is up to UE\nimplementation.  \n3\\. The UE sends a UE assistance report via the PMF protocol. The report\ncontains information that allows the UPF to identify traffic or PDR for\nwhich the UE assisted operation has been activated, and the desired\ndownlink traffic load balancing ratios for the associated downlink\ntraffic. If traffic splitting / load balancing is not allowed, the UE\nindicates the preferred access.  \nEditor\\'s note: It is FFS how ATSSS rules are indicated (e.g. using\ntraffic descriptors, identifier, etc) in the UE assistance report.\n\nInformation 4:\nSDF.

When this steering mode operation is applied, the UE decides\nhow traffic is steered, switched and split between 3GPP and non-3GPP\naccess based on UE state and UE knowledge of access conditions. The\nsolution works as follows.  \n1\\. The UE is configured with ATSSS rules including the UE assisted\ntraffic steering mode defined in Release 16 by the network. In addition,\nthe ATSSS rule indicates whether the \\\"UE assisted operation\\\" is\nallowed. Similarly, the UPF is configured with N4 rules, indicating\nwhether the UE is allowed to use UE assisted operation. The network\nindicates if splitting / load balancing is allowed.  \n2\\. The UE monitors UE state and access conditions of both 3GPP and\nnon-3GPP accesses (e.g. power consumption profile). Based on UE\nmonitoring, the UE may decide to activate the \\\"UE assisted\noperation\\\". If traffic splitting / load balancing is allowed, the UE\nmay determine the desired ratio of traffic split for uplink and downlink\ndirections. If traffic splitting is not allowed, the UE decides which\naccess to use for steering and switching for uplink and preferred access\nfor downlink.  \n3\\. In the uplink, the UE distributes traffic based on the desired\ntraffic split ratio or preferred access for uplink. The UE informs the\nUPF of the desired traffic ratio or preferred access for the downlink\nvia the PMF protocol. It is up to the UPF to take into consideration the\ninformation provided by the UE for downlink scheduling purposes.  \nEditor\\'s note: What information the UE provides to UPF in order to\nallow the UPF to identify the traffic and related PDRs, MARs etc is FFS  \nThe new steering mode operation only applies to non-GBR traffic.  \nNOTE: As specified in rel-16, a GBR flow is sent over a single access,\ni.e. the access to which the QoS profile has been provided.  \nThe UE assisted operation works will all Release 16 steering modes, and\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the UE-assistance indication in load-balancing steering mode?

The\nenhancements add more advanced monitoring solutions that helps an\noperator to continuously deliver the expected level of communication\nservice quality when deploying a NetworkSlice or a NetworkSliceSubnet.  \nA closed control loop automatically adjusts and optimizes the services\nprovided over an NG-RAN and 5GC network based on the various performance\nmanagement, QoE input data, and the state of the 5G network, using data\nanalytics.

This implies that an ACCL will be assuring\ngoal(s) pertaining to the configured targets only. The SLS requirement\nmay come for a particular location. It would be beneficial if the ACL\ncan target a particular location while assuring the SLS. Strict SLS\nassurance for a service can be provided using ACL for a high-valued\nvertical customer present in a particular location. This will require\nconfiguring the ACL accordingly and would need ACL to collect the\nperformance measurements, while monitoring the network, for the same\ntarget location. The example of this may include SP assuring assurance\ngoal of guaranteed throughput for an eMBB service inside a customer\npremises.  \n6.2 Requirements\n----------------  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-01** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto take actions for a set of communication services serving certain\ngroup of UEs based on the target SLS.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-02** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto collect service experience information.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-03** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto analyse the performance information related to the set of\ncommunication services serving certain group of UEs.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-04** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto modify the configuration parameters related to the set of\ncommunication services serving certain group of UEs.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-05** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto collect NSI related data from one or more 5GC NF(s).  \nNOTE 1: An example for NSI related data may be QoE data.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-06** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto derive which communication service is associated to the QoE data from\nthe collected NSI related QoE data.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.1.4 Communication service SLS assurance control  \nThe goal of this use case is to enable the MnS consumer to control the\ncommunication service SLS assurance closed control loop(s) (e.g. specify\nthe SLS to be assured, enable/disable the SLS assurance, specify the\nassurance time for certain SLS) and obtain the SLS fulfilment\ninformation provided by MnS producer.

Such national laws and regulations define the\nextent to which functional capabilities in the present document are\napplicable in specific jurisdictions.  \n1 Scope\n=======  \nThe present document specifies both the architectural and functional\nsystem requirements for Lawful Interception (LI) in 3GPP networks. The\npresent document provides an LI architecture supporting both network\nlayer based and service layer based Interception.  \nNational regulations determine the specific set of LI functional\ncapabilities that are applicable to a specific 3GPP operator deployment.  \n2 References\n============  \nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in\nthis text, constitute provisions of the present document.  \n\\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\nedition number, version number, etc.) or non\u2011specific.  \n\\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.  \n\\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

There may\nalso be requirements unique to a specific region or country.  \nIn many cases, national regulation will require that LI activity is\nperformed entirely within a particular legal jurisdiction. Specifically\ninformation indicating the target of interception, is often not allowed\nto be provided to networks outside the jurisdiction of the particular\ncountry of the law enforcement agency that request interception. This\nmay e.g. imply that the satellite ground station and/or base station and\nthe core network all have to be in the same country as the UE, unless\ncountries have made specific agreements. It should therefore be possible\nto route satellite communication to the right core network based on UE\nlocation.  \nLocation Dependent Interception, (LDI) allows a 3GPP network to service\nmultiple interception jurisdictions within its service area. Multiple\nlaw enforcement agencies with their own interception areas can be served\nby the 3GPP network. All the information or rules given for interception\nwithin a 3GPP network apply to interception within an Interception Area\n(IA) when LDI is invoked. A target may be marked in one or more\ndifferent IAs within the same 3GPP network.  \nDepending on national requirements, the network operator may be required\n\nInformation 5:\ntelecommunications traffic and related information in communication\nsystems. Lawful Interception applies in accordance with applicable\nnational or regional laws and technical regulations.  \n1 Scope\n=======  \nThe present document specifies Stage 1 Lawful Interception requirements\nfor 3GPP networks and services.  \nRegional interception requirements can be satisfied by meeting the\ncorrect subset of requirements from the present document. Which CSP\nservices are subject to Lawful Interception is defined by national\nregulations.  \nThe presence of a requirement in the present document does not in itself\nimply or mandate that a 3GPP operator has an obligation to implement any\nnetwork service capability, which is not otherwise required to meet LI\nobligation compliance in relation to specific regulated services,\noffered by that 3GPP operator. Only those specific requirements and\nsub-clauses of the present document which are applicable to specific\nnetwork and/or service capabilities implemented in a 3GPP operator\\'s\nnetwork will be considered in scope for that operator. In all cases,\nlaws and regulations define which requirements are applicable to 3GPP\noperators in each country relative to the services offered by each 3GPP\noperator.  \nAs such not all requirements in the present document will apply in all\nnational jurisdictions or to all 3GPP operator deployments (e.g. if an\noperator does not offer voice services, then voice LI requirement in the\npresent document do not apply).  \nThe interception system defined in the present document provides LI\nbased on specific target identifiers.  \n2 References\n============  \nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in\nthis text, constitute provisions of the present document.  \n\\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\nedition number, version number, etc.) or non\u2011specific.  \n\\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.\n\nQuestion: When can target UEs be positioned for lawful interception services?

Whether a remote update (e.g. OTA) should over-ride the\nuser\\'s configuration is for further study and may be dependent on\napplication and regulatory considerations.  \n-   It shall be possible for the home operator (the PNO) to configure\nthe policy of the automatic network selection.  \n-   It shall be possible for the user and the home operator (the PNO) to\nenable/ disable the automatic network selection.  \n-   It shall be possible to prevent a 3^rd^ party (e.g. a SNO) and the\nuser from modifying the network selection criteria that are\nprovisioned and controlled by the home operator (the PNO).  \n7.2 Behaviour of the UE\n-----------------------  \nWhere a UE has both 3GPP and non-3GPP access types, the behaviour of the\nUE in selecting 3GPP access shall follow the existing network selection\nmechanism. A similar but separate mechanism shall be defined to manage\nthe non-3GPP access.  \nIt should be possible for the home operator (the PNO) and the end-user\nto set the condition in the UE so that it will use either the 3GPP\naccess or the non-3GPP access mechanism as the default.\n\nInformation 2:\nWhen the UE decides to use untrusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G\nCore Network in a PLMN:  \n\\- the UE first selects and connects with a non-3GPP access network; and\nthen  \n\\- the UE selects a PLMN and an N3IWF in this PLMN. The PLMN/N3IWF\nselection and the non-3GPP access network selection are independent. The\nN3IWF selection is defined in clause6.3.6.  \nWhen the UE decides to use trusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G\nCore Network in a PLMN:  \n\\- the UE first selects a PLMN; and then  \n\\- the UE selects a non-3GPP access network (a TNAN) that supports\ntrusted connectivity to the selected PLMN. In this case, the non-3GPP\naccess network selection is affected by the PLMN selection.  \nA UE that accesses the 5G Core Network over a non-3GPP access shall,\nafter UE registration, support NAS signalling with 5G Core Network\ncontrol-plane functions using the N1 reference point.  \nWhen a UE is connected via a NG-RAN and via a non-3GPP access, multiple\nN1 instances shall exist for the UE i.e. there shall be one N1 instance\nover NG-RAN and one N1 instance over non-3GPP access.  \nA UE simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network of a PLMN over\na 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access shall be served by a single AMF in\nthis 5G Core Network.  \nWhen a UE is connected to a 3GPP access of a PLMN, if the UE selects a\nN3IWF and the N3IWF is located in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the\n3GPP access, e.g. in a different VPLMN or in the HPLMN, the UE is served\nseparately by the two PLMNs. The UE is registered with two separate\nAMFs. PDU Sessions over the 3GPP access are served by V-SMFs different\nfrom the V-SMF serving the PDU Sessions over the non-3GPP access. The\nsame can be true when the UE uses trusted non-3GPP access, i.e. the UE\nmay select one PLMN for 3GPP access and a different PLMN for trusted\nnon-3GPP access.  \nNOTE: The registrations with different PLMNs over different Access Types\ndoesn\\'t apply to UE registered for Disaster Roaming service as\n\nInformation 3:\nnetwork within a list.  \n-   It should be possible for the user to select a preferred non-3GPP\nnetwork from a list without the need to scan through all available\nnetworks.  \n8.2 Behaviour of the UE\n-----------------------  \nIt is not intended to specify how a UE should allow an end user to\nselect non-3GPP access types when in manual mode, however, some\nguidelines are discussed below.  \n8.3 Network identification\n--------------------------  \nAs described in section 6.2, above, non-3GPP access types do not have\nstandardised identities. It may be possible to agree some form of\nstandardised naming for some of these as discussed above but most will\nprobably have arbitrary names. It is important that the end user can\neasily identify any of these that are recommended by the HPLMN, however.  \n8.4 Presentation to the user\n----------------------------  \nThe non-3GPP access types could be listed separately from the available\nPLMNs or within the PLMN list presented to the user. In this case, it is\nimportant that any non-3GPP access types are clearly identifiable.  \n8.5 Selection by the user\n-------------------------  \nThe method by which the end user will select non-3GPP access types will\ndepend on the UE manufacturers\\' implementations.  \n9 Requirements for operator management\n======================================  \n9.1 General requirements\n------------------------  \nThe home operator (PNO) management shall be supported for following\npurposes:  \n-   To limit the networks that can be automatically selected by the\nUEs.(e.g. using a Black List or Forbidden list).  \n-   To control the policy of the automatic network selection (e.g.\ndefine under what circumstances selection would take place).  \n-   To prevent the modification of the configuration of automatic\nnetwork selection by the users.  \nThe high level requirements for home operator (PNO) management are as\nfollows:  \n-   It shall be possible to configure the list of the networks that can\n\nInformation 4:\noperators  \nThe UE behaviour in both of these configurations shall be the same. No\ninformation concerning the configuration of a shared network shall be\nindicated to the UE.  \nFor the Evolved Packet System, only the PS domain of the above figures\nis relevant. For E\u2011UTRAN access Figures1 and 2 both apply but with the\nMME replacing the SGSN, the eNodeB replacing the RNC, and the S1\nreference point replacing the Iu interface.  \nFor GERAN access, both GWCN and MOCN are applicable but with the BSC\nreplacing the RNC and the A/Gb-Interfaces replacing the Iu interface.  \n4.2 Core Network Operator and Network Selection\n-----------------------------------------------  \nNetwork sharing is an agreement between operators and shall be\ntransparent to the user. This implies that a supporting UE needs to be\nable to discriminate between core network operators available in a\nshared radio access network and that these operators can be handled in\nthe same way as operators in non-shared networks.\n\nInformation 5:\nWhen the UE decides to use untrusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G\nCore Network in a PLMN:  \n\\- the UE first selects and connects with a non-3GPP access network; and\nthen  \n\\- the UE selects a PLMN/SNPN and an N3IWF in this PLMN/SNPN.

When receiving an NGAP Paging message\nfor a WUS-capable UE that also includes the *Assistance Data for\nRecommended Cells IE* then a WUS-capable ng-eNB shall only broadcast the\nWUS on the cell that matches the last used cell ID.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.4.9 Wake Up Signal Assistance  \n#### 5.4.9.1 General  \nThe RAN and UE may use a Wake Up Signal (WUS) to reduce the UE\\'s idle\nmode power consumption. The RAN sends the WUS shortly before the UE\\'s\npaging occasion. The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the\npaging occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not\nbe paged if their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if\ntheir WUS is transmitted (see TS36.304\\[52\\]).  \nTo avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple\ncells (e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency\nservices such as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is\nrestricted to the last used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE\\'s RRC\nconnection was last released.

The SMF does not send any additional\nNamf\\_Communication\\_N1N2MessageTransfer message if subsequent downlink\ndata packets are received.  \n3\\. \\[Conditional\\] If the UE is in CM Idle, the AMF sends a paging\nmessage to NG-RAN. If available, the AMF may include the WUS Assistance\nInformation in the N2 Paging message(s).  \n4\\. \\[Conditional\\] If NG-RAN received a paging message from AMF and UE\nand NG-RAN support WUS, then:  \n\\- if the NGAP Paging message contains the *Assistance Data for\nRecommended Cells* IE (see TS38.413\\[10\\]), then NG-RAN shall only\nbroadcast the UE\\'s Wake Up Signal in the last used cell;  \n\\- else (i.e. the *Assistance Data for Recommended Cells* IE is not\nincluded in the NGAP Paging message) NG-RAN should not broadcast the\nUE\\'s Wake Up Signal.  \nNG-RAN performs paging. If the WUS Assistance Information is included in\nthe N2 Paging message, the NG-eNB takes it into account when paging the\nUE (see TS36.300\\[46\\]).  \n5\\. \\[Conditional\\] If the UE receives paging message, it responds with\na NAS message sent over RRC Connection Establishment.  \nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and is using the Multi-USIM\nPaging Rejection feature (see clause5.38 of TS23.501\\[2\\]), upon\nreception of paging request and if the UE determines not to accept the\npaging, the UE attempts to send a Reject Paging Indication via the UE\nTriggered Service Request procedure (clause4.2.3.2) unless it is unable\nto do so, e.g. due to UE implementation constraints.  \n5a. \\[Conditional\\] In the NB-IoT case, during Step 5, the NG-RAN, based\non configuration, may retrieve the NB-IoT UE Priority and the Expected\nUE Behaviour Parameters from the AMF, if not previously retrieved.

Such mobile base\nstation relay is assumed to be mounted on a moving vehicle and serve UEs\nthat can be located inside or outside the vehicle (or entering/leaving\nthe vehicle).  \nNOTE: The radio link used between a mobile base station relay and served\nUEs, as well as between mobile base station relay and donor RAN, is\nassumed to be NR-Uu; in that regard, it should be clear that a mobile\nbase station relay is different than a UE relay (which uses instead a\nPC5-based link to provide indirect connection to remote UEs).  \nFew main underlying assumptions are:  \n\\- requirements cover single-hop relay scenarios as baseline (multi-hop\nis not precluded);  \n\\- legacy UEs are supported;  \n\\- other stage-1 requirements (e.g. on wireless self-backhaul), as well\nas existing stage-2/3 functionalities and architecture options (e.g.\nIAB) do not assume or address full relay mobility (e.g. relays on board\nof moving vehicles), thus cannot cover the requirements below, which are\nintended to be specific to mobile base station relays;  \n> \\- the identified requirements do not intend to imply or exclude\n> specific network/relay architectures and topology solutions (e.g.\n> could be IAB based, or others);  \n\\- the MNO managing mobile base station relays, and the RAN/5GC they\nconnect to, can be a PLMN or an NPN operator.\n\nInformation 4:\naccessing to 5GC via NR satellite access and NR terrestrial access\nsimultaneously.  \nThe 5G system shall be able to support service continuity for mobile\nbase station relays using at least one 3GPP satellite NG-RAN.  \nNOTE 7: This requirement applies to scenarios where there is a\ntransition between two 3GPP NG-RAN, operated by the same MNO, involving\nat least one 3GPP satellite NG-RAN.  \nThe 5G system shall be able to identify and differentiate UEs' traffic\ncarried via a mobile base station relay and collect charging\ninformation, including specific relay information (e.g. geographic\nlocation served by the relay).  \nThe 5G system shall support means for a mobile base station relay to\nhave a certain subscription with a HPLMN, used to get access and\nconnectivity to the HPLMN network (via a donor RAN).  \nThe 5G system shall support the ability of a base station relay to roam\nfrom its HPLMN into a VPLMN.  \nThe 5G system shall support mechanisms, for the HPLMN controlling a\nmobile base station relay, to enable/disable mobile relay operation if\nthe relay is roaming in a VPLMN.  \nThe 5G system shall support mechanisms to disable mobile relay operation\nby a VPLMN where a mobile base station relay is roaming to.  \nThe 5G system shall be able to fulfil necessary regulatory requirements\n(e.g. for support of emergency services) when UEs access the 3GPP\nnetwork via a mobile base station relay.  \nThe 5G system shall be able to support priority services (e.g. MPS) when\nUEs access the 3GPP network via a mobile base station relay.  \nThe 5G system shall be able to support location services for the UEs\naccessing 5GS via a mobile base station relay.  \nThe 5G system shall ensure that existing end-to-end 5G security between\nthe UE and 3GPP network is unaffected when the UE accesses the 3GPP\nnetwork via a mobile base station relay.  \nThe 5G system shall be able to minimize radio interference possibly\ncaused by mobile base station relays.\n\nInformation 5:\nconnect to the network,  \n\\- the 3GPP network the relay UE connects to (either directly or\nindirectly),  \n\\- the overall optimization of the power consumption/performance of the\n3GPP system, or  \n\\- battery capabilities and battery lifetime of the relay UE and the\nremote UE.  \n> NOTE: Reselection may be triggered by any dynamic change in the\n> selection criteria, e.g. by the battery of a relay UE getting\n> depleted, a new relay capable UE getting in range, a remote UEs\n> requesting additional resources or higher QoS, etc.  \n#### 6.9.2.5 Satellite and Relay UEs  \nFor a 5G system with satellite access, the following requirements apply:  \n\\- A 5G system with satellite access shall be able to support relay\nUE\\'s with satellite access.  \nNOTE: The connection between a relay UE and a remote UE is the same\nregardless of whether the relay UE is using satellite access or not.  \n\\- A 5G system with satellite access shall support mobility management\nof relay UEs and the remote UEs connected to the relay UE between a 5G\nsatellite access network and a5G terrestrial network, and between 5G\nsatellite access networks.  \n\\- A 5G system with satellite access shall support joint roaming between\ndifferent 5G networks of a relay UE and the remote UEs connected to that\nrelay UE.  \n6.10 Network capability exposure\n--------------------------------\n\nQuestion: What does the 5G system need to provide for mobile base station relays using 5G connectivity provided by a different MNO?

An MDA MnS (also\nreferred to as MDAS) defined in TS28.104\\[15\\] enables any authorized\nconsumer to request and receive analytics. The architecture is shown in\nFigure 1.  \nFigure 6.72.1-1: MDA functional overview and service framework (source\nTS28.104\\[15\\])  \nAccording to TS28.104\\[15\\], a management function (MDAF) may play the\nroles of MDA MnS producer, MDA MnS consumer, other MnS consumer, NWDAF\nconsumer and LMF service consumer, and may also interact with other\nnon-3GPP management systems.  \nThe internal business logic related to MDA leverages the current and\nhistorical data related to:  \n\\- Performance Measurements (PM) according to TS28.552\\[7\\] and Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) according to TS28.554\\[9\\].  \n\\- Trace data, including MDT/RLF/RCEF, according to TS32.422\\[22\\] and\nTS32.423\\[23\\].  \n\\- QoE and service experience data according to TS28.405\\[24\\] and\nTS28.406\\[25\\].  \n\\- Analytics data offered by NWDAF according to TS23.288\\[5\\]\nincluding 5GC data and external web/app-based information (e.g. web\ncrawler that provides online news) from AF.  \n\\- Alarm information and notifications according to TS28.532\\[26\\].  \n\\- CM information and notifications.  \n\\- UE location information provided by LMF according to\nTS23.273\\[13\\].  \n\\- MDA reports from other MDA MnS producers.  \n\\- Management data from non-3GPP systems.  \nAnalytics output from the MDA internal business logic are made available\nby the management functions (MDAFs) playing the role of MDA MnS\nproducers to the authorized consumers, (including but not limited to\nother management functions, network functions/entities, NWDAF, SON\nfunctions, optimization tools and human operators).  \nThe analytics provided by MDAS include analytics for fault management\npredictions/statistics. The MDA can supervise the status of various\n\nInformation 2:\n### 6.10.4 Confidence indicator in analysis results  \nA *consumer of MDAS should treat the results of Management Data\nAnalytics with caution. A decision based on analytics should take into\naccount the degree of confidence of the analysis result, especially in\nthe case when multiple analysis results are based on different models or\ndifferent source data.*  \n*Therefore it is proposed that the result of Management Data Analytics\nshould contain an attribute which indicates the degree of confidence of\nthe analysis.*  \nNOTE: How to evaluate a degree of confidence and how it should be\nexpressed as an attribute are not addressed in this study.

In general, the application\nwith a long recovery time may require very stringent communication\nservice reliability as any occurrence of communication failure greatly\nimpacts the application down-time and hence the overall production\nsystem availability. On the other hand, if the application recovers very\nfast, it can likely tolerate more frequent failures of the communication\nsystem, while achieving the same overall production system availability\ntarget. In such case the communication service reliability could be more\nrelaxed (compared to the above case).  \nD.2 Communication system parameters and influence quantities\n------------------------------------------------------------  \nWhile application availability is the KPI for industrial automation, the\napplication per se is outside the scope of 3GPP. 3GPP's scope includes\nproviding communications system which, with the appropriate deployment\noptions, can meet the performance indicators to support application's\ncommunications needs. A number of parameters and influence quantities\ncan be taken into account to maximize support for application\navailability, to the extent possible by the 3GPP system. From the\nillustrations above, these include communication service availability,\ncommunication service reliability, and survival time.  \n######### Annex E: Requirements mapping use case to merged  \nThe potential new requirements of the studied use cases in clause 5 have\nbeen consolidated into the merged potential service requirements in\nclause 6.

Machines\nthat are cooperating are connected via cable, typically using an\nindustrial ethernet technology like PROFINET. With the introduction of\n5G and the advent of Industry 4.0, however, the goal is for factories to\nbecome increasingly flexible and modular. In frequently changing,\nmodular production environments wired links are not viable. 5G will\nenable these use cases by replacing the wired links with 5G wireless\nlinks.  \n![](media/image22.wmf){width=\"6.383333333333334in\"\nheight=\"2.558333333333333in\"}  \nFigure 5.16.1-1: Example of four cooperating machines with wired\nconnections \\[12\\]  \nWe assume two or more machines (typically 4 or 5) to be cooperating with\neach other during production. Figure 5.16.1-1 shows an example of a\nproduction cell with four cooperating machines connected via cable. A\nproduction cell combines machines based on the manufacturing process. In\norder to replace the cables between the four cooperating machines and\nthe supervisory PLC, each machine is equipped with one UE, connected to\nthe controller (shown in Figure 5.16.1-2). From a communication\nrequirements point of view, the supervisory PLC is equal to the\nmachine's PLCs. The cooperating machine's communication can be divided\ninto two types. Periodic traffic and a-periodic traffic, as defined in\n\\[2\\]. Both the periodic and a-periodic traffic are scheduled, therefore\nthe a-periodic traffic is also adhering to the transfer interval. The\ntraffic requirements are from the point of view of the UE and give the\nmaximum aggregate traffic of all links. Meaning, the traffic per link\nmay change according to the number of cooperating machines but the total\ntraffic at the UE cannot exceed the given values.  \nIn traditional production setups the cooperating machines use either 100\nMbit/s or 1 Gbit/s links, depending on the application (e.g. 1 Gbit/s\n\nInformation 5:\n3GPP 5G network may introduce a scenario where information transmitted\nover the wireless medium can be prone to potential attacks on the\nproduction line as unauthorized parties may get access to the control\nand production data. For example, the injection of malicious messages\nsuch as false emergency-stop commands can be very detrimental to the\nproduction system. This is a general concern for the overall acceptance\nof wireless technology in the industrial domain albeit performance\ndegradation issues.  \n**Dynamic flow control and seamless handover:** high\nSignal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and fading radio channels may result in\nfluctuations in a dynamic factory due to mobility support. This\ntherefore requires well specified worst-case scenarios for\nre-configuration of communication services over the network in order to\nguarantee QoS. Furthermore, potential handovers from one access point to\nanother can cause additional delays or packet losses.  \n**Interference and co-existence of communication services:** The panel\nsupports different services such as monitoring and control. Each of\nthese services require different communication services with varied QoS\nguarantee. It is therefore important that the co-existence of these\nservices on the network can be clearly supported in terms of\nidentification and QoS guarantees. Also, interference from other panels\nmay lead to performance degradation in a wireless network.  \n**Robustness, availability, and latency:** These are key communication\nservice performance indicators for the use case which has very\ndeterministic bounds and as such is very difficult to guarantee on\nwireless and mostly non-industrial networks.  \n**Safety**: The mobile operation panel is used to perform\nsafety-critical control services, including the control of mobile robots\nand emergency stop functionality.\n\nQuestion: What is the typical connection density in factory automation applications?

Again the collocation ordering takes precedence.  \nThe MME would use the IP addresses from the records (not shown) for the\nS11 Create Session Request attempt.  \nAssuming it succeeds we would not need to try any other PGW or SGW\nrecords.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 6.6.4 Evaluation  \nThe assigned IP address is unique within an TNGF and can be used as\nidentifier to locate the security key.  \nThe TNGF has to identify an anonymous SUCI and uses in that case the IP\naddress of the UE to locate the key. Another issue is, the TNGF may not\nbe always involved to assign the IP address according to the TS\n23.502\\[7\\], thus the solution may need the TNAP to send the IP address\nof the UE to the TNGF when the TNAP is used to assign the IP address.\nThus, it may impact to protocol used between TNAP and TNGF.  \n6.7 Solution \\#7: Untrusted non-3GPP Access for SNPN\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.5.17 *ANDSF*/DiscoveryInformation/*\\<X\\>*/AccessNetworkArea/ 3GPP2\\_Location/1x/*\\<X\\>*/NID  \nThis NID leaf indicates a Network Identification code for one particular\n3GPP2 1x RAT location description.  \n\\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne  \n\\- Format: chr  \n\\- Access Types: Get, Replace  \n\\- Values: \\<Network Identification\\>  \nThe format of the NID is defined by 3GPP2C.S0016\\[14\\].\n\nInformation 5:\ndiscovery and selection procedure is performed.  \nFor example, the SGW-C shall discover a UP function capable to serve as\na SGW-U using the \\\"Service Parameters\\\" of:  \n\\\"x-3gpp-upf:x-sxa+ue-\\<ue usage type\\>\\\"  \nThe S-NAPTR procedure employed to discover and select an SGW-U shall use\nthe Application-Unique String set to the TAI/eNodeB-ID/RAI/RNC-ID FQDN,\nand use the enhanced \\\"Service Parameters\\\" as specified in\nclause19.4.3 of 3GPPTS23.003\\[4\\], i.e. appending the character\nstring \\\"+nc-\\<network-capability\\>\\\" to the \\'app-protocol\\' name\nidentifying specific SGW-U supporting a particular network capability.  \nFor example, the SGW-C shall discover a UP function capable to serve as\na SGW-U using the \\\"Service Parameters\\\" of:  \n\\\"x-3gpp-upf:x-sxa+nc-\\<network-capability\\>\\\"  \n5.11 Procedures for Discovering and Selecting PGW-U\n---------------------------------------------------  \nThese procedures shall be employed when a PGW-U needs to be selected by\nan PGW-C and the PGW-C supports the UP selection function based on DNS\nspecified in Annex B.2.6 of 3GPPTS29.244\\[26\\].  \nOperators shall provision, for each APNs configured in their network,\nNAPTR records under the APN FQDN corresponding to each UP function\nserving as a PGW-U with the following \\\"Service Parameters\\\":  \n\\\"x-3gpp-upf:x-sxb\\\"  \nwhere additional \\\"Service Parameters\\\" may be included optionally.

The CCE\naggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE\naggregation level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.  \nIf a UE is not provided *pei-SearchSpace* for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set, the\nUE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The\nCCE aggregation levels and the maximum number of PDCCH candidates per\nCCE aggregation level for Type2A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table\n10.1-1. If the UE is provided *pei-SearchSpace* with zero value for the\nType2A-PDCCH CSS set index, and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET\nmultiplexing patterns 2 and 3, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring\noccasions as described in clause 13 and the CCE aggregation levels and\nthe number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level for\nType2A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.  \nIf a UE is provided a zero value for *searchSpaceID in\nPDCCH-ConfigCommon* *for* a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, or is provided a\nzero value for *searchSpaceMCCH* or *searchSpaceMTCH*, the UE determines\nmonitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS\nset as described in clause 13, and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE\nmonitors PDCCH candidates only at monitoring occasions associated with a\nSS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block is determined by the most recent\nof  \n\\- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP\nthat includes a CORESET with index 0, as described in \\[6, TS 38.214\\],\nwhere the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the\nSS/PBCH block, or  \n\\- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that\ntriggers a contention-free random access procedure\n\nInformation 3:\nFor a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided *searchSpaceSIB1* for Type0-PDCCH\nCSS set by *PDCCH-ConfigCommon*, the UE does not monitor PDCCH\ncandidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS\nset is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH\ncandidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1.  \nIf the active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP for a UE have same SCS and\nsame CP length and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET\nwith index 0, or the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, or the active\nDL BWP includes all RBs of an MBS frequency resource provided by\n*cfr-ConfigMCCH-MTCH* as described in clause 18, the CORESET configured\nfor Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set\nhas search space set index 0.  \nIf the active DL BWP and an MBS frequency resource provided by\n*cfr-ConfigMCCH-MTCH* or determined by CORESET with index 0 when\n*cfr-ConfigMCCH-MTCH* is not provided for a UE have same SCS and same CP\nlength and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the MBS frequency\nresource, and if the UE is provided *searchSpaceMCCH* or\n*searchSpaceMTCH* for Type0B-PDCCH CSS set on the primary cell or for\nType3-PDCCH CSS set on a secondary cell, the UE monitors PDCCH for\ndetection of broadcast DCI formats, as described in clause 18, on the\nactive DL BWP.  \nFor a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided\n*searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation* for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE\ndoes not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE\naggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE\naggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.  \nFor a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided *ra-SearchSpace* for Type1-PDCCH\nCSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set on the DL\nBWP*.* If the UE has not been provided a Type3-PDCCH CSS set, or a\nType1A-PDCCH CSS set, or a USS set and the UE has received a C-RNTI and\nhas been provided a Type1-PDCCH CSS set, the UE monitors PDCCH\n\nInformation 4:\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+  \n#### 5.1.1.11 Applicability of requirements for RedCap  \nThe performance requirements in Table 5.1.1.11-1 shall apply for UEs\nwhich support optional feature *supportOfRedCap*.  \nOther performance requirements mandatory for UE supporting NR operation\ndefined in Section 5 but not included in table 5.1.1.11-1 should not be\nconsidered applicable to RedCap UEs.  \nTable 5.1.1.11-1: Requirements applicability for RedCap  \n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n| UE capability   | Test type       | Test list | Applicability   |   |\n|                 |                 |           | notes           |   |\n+=================+=================+===========+=================+===+\n| RedCap with 1RX | FR1 FDD and     | PDSCH     | All tests in    |   |\n|                 | HD-FDD (Note 1) |           | Clause          |   |\n|                 |                 |           | 5.2.1.1.1       |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 |                 | PDCCH     | All tests in    |   |\n|                 |                 |           | Clause          |   |\n|                 |                 |           | 5.3.1.1.1       |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 |                 | PBCH      | All tests in    |   |\n|                 |                 |           | Clause 5.4.1.1  |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 |                 | SDR       | Clause 5.5.1    |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 | FR1 TDD         | PDSCH     | All tests in    |   |\n|                 |                 |           | Clause          |   |\n|                 |                 |           | 5.2.1.2.1       |   |\n\nInformation 5:\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+  \n#### 5.1.1.11 Applicability of requirements for RedCap  \nThe performance requirements in Table 5.1.1.11-1 shall apply for UEs\nwhich support optional feature *supportOfRedCap*.  \nOther performance requirements mandatory for UE supporting NR operation\ndefined in Section 5 but not included in table 5.1.1.11-1 should not be\nconsidered applicable to RedCap UEs.  \nTable 5.1.1.11-1: Requirements applicability for RedCap  \n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n| UE capability   | Test type       | Test list | Applicability   |   |\n|                 |                 |           | notes           |   |\n+=================+=================+===========+=================+===+\n| RedCap with 1RX | FR1 FDD and     | PDSCH     | All tests in    |   |\n|                 | HD-FDD (Note 1) |           | Clause          |   |\n|                 |                 |           | 5.2.1.1.1       |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 |                 | PDCCH     | All tests in    |   |\n|                 |                 |           | Clause          |   |\n|                 |                 |           | 5.3.1.1.1       |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 |                 | PBCH      | All tests in    |   |\n|                 |                 |           | Clause 5.4.1.1  |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 |                 | SDR       | Clause 5.5.1    |   |\n+-----------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---+\n|                 | FR1 TDD         | PDSCH     | All tests in    |   |\n|                 |                 |           | Clause          |   |\n|                 |                 |           | 5.2.1.2.1       |   |\n\nQuestion: What does a RedCap UE expect if it monitors PDCCH according to Type1-PDCCH CSS set and does not monitor PDCCH according to Type2-PDCCH CSS set?
