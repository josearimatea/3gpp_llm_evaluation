        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nintroduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a\nsteering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and\ndownlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP\naccesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering Functionality   | Indicates the applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | traffic steering         |             |\n|                          | functionality.           |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)    | Indicates the UL and/or  | Optional    |\n|                          | DL traffic distribution  |             |\n|                          | rules between the 3GPP   |             |\n|                          | and Non-3GPP accesses    |             |\n|                          | together with associated |             |\n|                          | parameters (when         |             |\n|                          | applicable) for the      |             |\n|                          | traffic matching the     |             |\n|                          | service data flow.       |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode indicator  | Indicates either         | Optional    |\n|                          | autonomous load-balance  |             |\n|                          | operation or             |             |\n|                          | UE-assistance operation, |             |\n|                          | if the steering mode is  |             |\n|                          | set to                   |             |\n|                          | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".     |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Threshold value(s)       | Indicates, as applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | for the steering mode,   |             |\n|                          | the threshold value(s)   |             |\n|                          | for maximum RTT or       |             |\n|                          | maximum Packet Loss      |             |\n\nInformation 3:\napplicable to non-GBR SDF;  \nC\\) load balancing, the UE steers the SDF across both the 3GPP access\nand the non-3GPP access with a given precentage if both accesses are\navailable.

If the steering functionality is set to ATSSS-LL functionality, the\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.2.2 High-level Description  \nThis steering mode, called Autonomous steering mode, provides to both\nthe UE and the UPF flexibility on the traffic splitting control in order\nto maximize the bandwidth/throughput when two accesses are applicable\nfor this traffic. For example, some traffic has high bandwidth\nrequirement, such as video service, download service, etc, the higher\nbandwidth/throughput is provided by the network, the better service\nquality can be achieved. Then the autonomous steering mode can be\napplied on these traffic for UE and UPF to flexibly adjust the weight\nfactor on both accesses in order to maximize the bandwidth/throughput.\nAdditionally, this Autonomous steering mode should only be allowed by\nthe operator when both accesses can be applied to transport the traffic,\nand from the operator point of view, high bandwidth/throughput is more\nimportant than the control on the access selection for the traffic\nsteering/switching/splitting. See Figure 6.2.2-1 for details, where one\nsingle packet flow is shown as an example for UL and DL respectively.\nThe weight factor for the traffic over each access, e.g. 30% for UL and\n50% for DL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP\naccess, as shown in the figure, is decided by the UE and the UPF\nindependently for both UL and DL, subject to link status to achieve the\nhigh bandwidth/throughput. As the weight factor for each access can be\nadjusted dynamically by the UE and the UPF, there is no need for the\nPCF/SMF to send the static weight factor values to the UE and the UPF.  \nNOTE1: It can also be considered to send the initial weight factor to\nthe UE and the UPF from the PCF/SMF. This initial value is applied at\nthe beginning of the traffic steering when the link status measurement\nhas not been started.  \nFigure 6.2.2-1: Autonomous steering mode  \nOptionally, the threshold can also be provided together with the\nAutonomous steering mode, including Maximum RTT, UL/DL Maximum Packet\n\nInformation 5:\n|                           | Steering mode, the        |           |\n|                           | Steering mode indicator   |           |\n|                           | and the Threshold values. |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering Functionality    | Indicates the applicable  | Optional  |\n|                           | traffic steering          |           |\n|                           | functionality.            |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)     | Indicates the UL and/or   | Optional  |\n|                           | DL traffic distribution   |           |\n|                           | rules between the 3GPP    |           |\n|                           | and Non-3GPP accesses     |           |\n|                           | together with associated  |           |\n|                           | parameters (when          |           |\n|                           | applicable) for the       |           |\n|                           | traffic matching the      |           |\n|                           | service data flow.        |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode indicator   | Indicates either          | Optional  |\n|                           | autonomous load-balance   |           |\n|                           | operation or              |           |\n|                           | UE-assistance operation,  |           |\n|                           | if the steering mode is   |           |\n|                           | set to                    |           |\n|                           | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".      |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Threshold values          | Indicates the threshold   | Optional  |\n|                           | value(s) for maximum RTT  |           |\n\nQuestion: What does the Load-Balancing steering mode do? [3GPP Release 17]\nThink step by step before answering and analyze the relevant information carefully, then respond with a final answer in the format 'answer: <XXXXX>'.assistant\n\nanswer: The Load-Balancing steering mode splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses, typically with a split percentage (e.g., 20% on 3GPP and 80% on non-3GPP). However, in Rel-17, the Load-Balancing steering mode can provide an \"autonomous load-balance indicator\" allowing the UE and UPF to freely select their own percentages, which may change over time to maximize throughput."

This information can be of interest\nto the 5GMS Application Provider or to other Network Functions in the 5G\nSytem.  \nThe following extensions (Stage 2 and Stage 3) are recommended:  \n\\- Identify and define the media-related data to be exposed by the 5GMS\nAF towards the 5G System and other event consumer entities. Work with\nother 3GPP groups for carriage in existing AF events or the definition\nof new AF Events.  \n\\- Enhance the 5GMS AF data collection to support direct and indirect\ncollection of UE data pertaining to media sessions.  \n\\- Devise mechanisms to control the access to the collected media\nsession data.  \n\\- Define a generic architecture within which media-specific solutions\nfor the configuration and subsequent operation of data collection and\ndata reporting (via event exposure) by the AF can be specified.  \n6.9 Per-application-authorization\n---------------------------------  \nThe 5G Media Streaming Architecture enables a 5GMS-Aware Application to\naccess certain network features, in alignment with the 5GMS Application\nProvider.

        "answer": "option 3: To enable the UE and UPF to freely select split percentages for each access type",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nintroduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a\nsteering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and\ndownlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP\naccesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements.

Then the autonomous steering mode can be\napplied on these traffic for UE and UPF to flexibly adjust the weight\nfactor on both accesses in order to maximize the bandwidth/throughput.\nAdditionally, this Autonomous steering mode should only be allowed by\nthe operator when both accesses can be applied to transport the traffic,\nand from the operator point of view, high bandwidth/throughput is more\nimportant than the control on the access selection for the traffic\nsteering/switching/splitting. See Figure 6.2.2-1 for details, where one\nsingle packet flow is shown as an example for UL and DL respectively.\nThe weight factor for the traffic over each access, e.g. 30% for UL and\n50% for DL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP\naccess, as shown in the figure, is decided by the UE and the UPF\nindependently for both UL and DL, subject to link status to achieve the\nhigh bandwidth/throughput. As the weight factor for each access can be\nadjusted dynamically by the UE and the UPF, there is no need for the\nPCF/SMF to send the static weight factor values to the UE and the UPF.  \nNOTE1: It can also be considered to send the initial weight factor to\nthe UE and the UPF from the PCF/SMF. This initial value is applied at\nthe beginning of the traffic steering when the link status measurement\nhas not been started.  \nFigure 6.2.2-1: Autonomous steering mode  \nOptionally, the threshold can also be provided together with the\nAutonomous steering mode, including Maximum RTT, UL/DL Maximum Packet\n\nInformation 4:\n|                           | Steering mode, the        |           |\n|                           | Steering mode indicator   |           |\n|                           | and the Threshold values. |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering Functionality    | Indicates the applicable  | Optional  |\n|                           | traffic steering          |           |\n|                           | functionality.            |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)     | Indicates the UL and/or   | Optional  |\n|                           | DL traffic distribution   |           |\n|                           | rules between the 3GPP    |           |\n|                           | and Non-3GPP accesses     |           |\n|                           | together with associated  |           |\n|                           | parameters (when          |           |\n|                           | applicable) for the       |           |\n|                           | traffic matching the      |           |\n|                           | service data flow.        |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode indicator   | Indicates either          | Optional  |\n|                           | autonomous load-balance   |           |\n|                           | operation or              |           |\n|                           | UE-assistance operation,  |           |\n|                           | if the steering mode is   |           |\n|                           | set to                    |           |\n|                           | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".      |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Threshold values          | Indicates the threshold   | Optional  |\n|                           | value(s) for maximum RTT  |           |\n\nInformation 5:\n1\\) For the Load-Balancing steering mode:  \n\\- The network may not provide pre-defined split percentages, in which\ncase the UE and the UPF can freely and independently decide how to split\nthe traffic across the two accesses.  \nNOTE1: The above bullet covers the \\\"autonomous\\\" steering mode defined\nin Solution \\#2.

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nThe following two scenarios are considered to support service\ncontinuity.  \n**Scenario 1: Slice resource shortage in case of Intra-RA mobility and\nInter-RA mobility**  \nFigure 6.1-1: Service interruption due to slice resource shortage  \nAs shown by Figure 6.1-1, the UE\\'s ongoing slice(s) is/are supported by\nboth the source and the target NG-RAN node. At the time of handover, the\ntarget node fails to accept the UE with at least one of the ongoing\nS-NSSAIs due to e.g. high slice-related load at the target node. Under\nsuch circumstance, the service(s) for failed ongoing slice(s) is/are\ninterrupted for the UE.  \nIt should be noted that remapping of traffic into the resource pool used\nby other slices requires a pre-configured policy allowing such action.\nThe remapping should avoid overloading the resource pool of the target\nslice. Any solution to this issue should comply with the RRM policy\nmodel defined in TS 28.541 \\[2\\] and be validated by SA5.  \nHow to support the slice recovery (i.e., re-mapping of remapped slice to\non-going slice) when the NG-RAN node recovers enough resources to serve\nthe on-going slice(s) will be discussed in normative phase.  \n**Scenario2: Non-supported slice in case of Inter-RA mobility**  \nFigure 6.1-2: Service interruption due to slice not supported  \nAs shown by Figure 6.1-2, the UE is moving towards an area that does not\nsupport at least one of UE\\'s ongoing slices.

The VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability\nenablement server  \n2\\. The VAL client of VAL UE is mapped to Slice\\#1, and NSCE client of\nVAL UE has established a connection to NSCE server\\#1 (S-NSCE server).  \n3\\. The S-NSCE server has already discovered the T-NSCE server and its\narea of coverage.  \n4\\. The VAL server is subscribed to and received prediction of UE\nlocation change  \nFigure 9.9.2.1-1: Support for predictive slice modification in\ndistributed NSCE server deployments  \n1\\. The VAL server sends to S-NSCE server an application service\ncontinuity requirement request due to predicted/expected UE or group UE\nmobility to a target service area covered by a different EDN.  \nNOTE: Such UE predicted mobility at the VAL server can be based on UE\nmobility analytics received by NWDAF or can be predicted by the VAL\nlayer (VAL server or VAL UE).  \n2\\. S-NSCE server sends an application service continuity requirement\nresponse to the VAL server as positive or negative acknowledgement.  \n3\\. S-NSCE server determines to query the underlying 3GPP system on the\nslice availability and conditions at the target service area (based on\nstep 1 requirement). Such query may be in form of a request/response and\ninclude:  \na\\. S-NSCE server interacting with 5GC to query the UE specific\ninformation (location, UE connection capabilities) as well as network\nconditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics\non the slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 \\[4\\]).  \nb\\. S-NSCE server may also interact with OAM to query on the target\n\nInformation 3:\n### 16.3.1 General Principles and Requirements  \nIn this clause, the general principles and requirements related to the\nrealization of network slicing in the NG-RAN for NR connected to 5GC and\nfor E-UTRA connected to 5GC are given.  \nA network slice always consists of a RAN part and a CN part. The support\nof network slicing relies on the principle that traffic for different\nslices is handled by different PDU sessions. Network can realise the\ndifferent network slices by scheduling and also by providing different\nL1/L2 configurations.  \nEach network slice is uniquely identified by a S-NSSAI, as defined in TS\n23.501 \\[3\\]. NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information)\nincludes one or a list of S-NSSAIs (Single NSSAI) where a S-NSSAI is a\ncombination of:  \n\\- mandatory SST (Slice/Service Type) field, which identifies the slice\ntype and consists of 8 bits (with range is 0-255);  \n\\- optional SD (Slice Differentiator) field, which differentiates among\nSlices with same SST field and consist of 24 bits.  \nThe list includes at most 8 S-NSSAI(s).  \nThe UE provides NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information)\nfor network slice selection in *RRCSetupComplete*, if it has been\nprovided by NAS (see clause 9.2.1.3). While the network can support\nlarge number of slices (hundreds), the UE need not support more than 8\nslices simultaneously. A BL UE or a NB-IoT UE supports a maximum of 8\nslices simultaneously.  \nNetwork Slicing is a concept to allow differentiated treatment depending\non each customer requirements. With slicing, it is possible for Mobile\nNetwork Operators (MNO) to consider customers as belonging to different\ntenant types with each having different service requirements that govern\nin terms of what slice types each tenant is eligible to use based on\nService Level Agreement (SLA) and subscriptions.  \nThe following key principles apply for support of Network Slicing in\nNG-RAN:  \n**RAN awareness of slices**\n\nInformation 4:\n### 4.3.3 Service Cardinality  \na\\) One NSCE server may enable one or more Network slice(s) identified\nby S-NSSAI(s);  \nb\\) One Network slice can only be enabled and served by one NSCE server.  \nc\\) The NSCE servers may provide service in the same or in different\nTracking Areas.  \n5 Key issues\n============  \n5.1 Key issue 1: Network slice capability management enhancements\n-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nSEAL is the service enabler architecture layer common to all vertical\napplications over 3GPP systems. It provides the functions like location\nmanagement, group management, configuration management, identity\nmanagement, key management, network resource management and network\nslice capability management as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 \\[2\\].  \nNetwork slicing is a general network capability which can be applied for\nmany vertical industries. The network slice capability management\nservice in 3GPP TS 23.434 \\[2\\] only provides capability of network\nslice adaptation between NSCE server and the NSCE client. However, for\nsuch capability both control plane and management plane interactions\nneed to be considered since there is close coupling between the per UE\nsession and the per slice related actions. For example, the SEAL/NSCE\nlayer may need to be aware of the slice provisioning parameters\n(NSI/NSSI configuration) which can be provided by the slice management\nsystem. Furthermore, NSI/NSSI performance monitoring from management\nsystem (e.g. NSI/ NSSI status) may be useful to be known at the enabler\nlayer, since this may affect the application to slice re-mapping\ntriggering (e.g. to re-map to the least congested slice); and may also\nimpact other SEAL provided functionalities (e.g. QoS/resource control,\ngroup management etc).  \nOpen issues:  \n\\- Whether and which enhancement to SEAL network slice capability\nmanagement service is required having in mind SA2 and SA5 slice related\nexposure?\n\nInformation 5:\nconfiguration, the common RACH configuration can be used.  \n*Support service continuity*  \nIn order to support service continuity for specific slice(s), the NG-RAN\nnode may use Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing or Resource Repartitioning\nto allocate resources to a slice in case of slice resources shortage.  \nIn Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing the RAN node can setup the dual\nconnectivity or carrier aggregation with different frequency and\noverlapping coverage where the same slice is available.  \nThe Resource Repartitioning allows a slice to use resources from the\nshared pool or/and prioritized pool when its own dedicated or\nprioritized resources are not available and the use of unused resources\nin the prioritized pool is as specified in TS 28.541.  \nSlice RRM policies/restrictions associated with Resource Repartitioning\nare configured from O&M.  \nMeasurements of RRM policy utilization according to resource types\ndefined in TS 28.541 are reported from RAN nodes to O&M and may lead O&M\nto update the configuration of the Slice RRM policies/restrictions.  \n*Support the enforcement of Slice MBR and the usage of Target NSSAI*  \nThe UE-Slice MBR is introduced to limit the aggregate bit rate that can\nbe expected to be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows\ncorresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) as\nspecified in TS 23.501 and is ensured by the RAN.  \nIn case of Dual Connectivity, the MN decides the DL UE Slice MBR and UL\nUE Slice MBR limits to be assigned to the SN, and indicates these to the\nSN. In addition, the PDCP entity at the SN applies the received DL UE\nSlice MBR limit to the set of all bearers for which the SN hosts PDCP\nfor the concerned Slice, as defined in TS 23.501, and the MAC entity at\nthe SN applies the received UL UE Slice MBR limit to the scheduled\nuplink radio traffic at the SN for the concerned Slice, as defined in TS\n23.501.  \nIn order to support the enforcement of Slice MBR, RAN interfaces\n\nQuestion: How is service continuity supported for specific slice(s)?

        "answer": "option 5: By dividing UEs into multiple subgroups",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n860247       **Perf. part: UE power saving enhancements for NR**   NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh-Perf   R4   RP-212630       MediaTek  \nSummary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.  \nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of\nexperienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power\nconsumption. UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the\nsuccess of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to\naddress outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power\nconsumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption\nwith traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the\nfollowing new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:  \n\u2022 Enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging\nenhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive\nmode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in\nconnected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs  \n\u2022 Enhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH\nmonitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG)\nswitching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM\nand/or BFD in connected mode  \n**[Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in\nidle/inactive mode]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the\ngroup of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple\nsubgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for\npaging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via\nassociated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging\nprobability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption\nin idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to\nmonitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall\nmonitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n\nInformation 2:\na factor of total PO number associated with up to two paging frames\n(PFs).  \n\u2022 The time location of PEI-O for UE\\'s PO is determined by a reference\npoint and a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the start of\nthe first PDCCH monitoring occasion of this PEI-O. The reference point\nis the start of a reference frame determined by a frame-level offset\nfrom the start of the first PF of the PF(s) associated with the PEI-O.\nThe time location of PEI-O can be configured so that total UE reception\npower consumption in idle/inactive mode, including synchronization and\nRRM measurements, can be minimized.  \n**[Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected\nmode to idle/inactive-mode UEs]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to synchronization for\npaging receptions, RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive\nUE(s) can be provided via system information (SIB17). By exploiting TRS\nfor synchronization, UE can reduce the number of wake-up for SSB before\na paging reception and potentially achieve longer sleep. It is noticed\nthat RS configuration in SIB17 does not affect the UE behaviour in\nCONNECTED mode and can be ignored by UE in CONNECTED mode.  \nThe maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is\n64. If a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability\nindication is always enabled based on that configuration. A UE which\nacquired SIB17 with a TRS configuration but did not yet receive an\nassociated L1-based availability indication considers the configured TRS\nas unavailable. The L1 availability indication is carried in a DCI\nformat 2\\_7, if configured, and a DCI format 1\\_0 with CRC scrambled by\nP-RNTI. The TRS availability indication field in the DCI format(s)\nprovides a bitmap for up to 6 groups of TRS resource sets where the\nconfiguration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit\nof the bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a validity duration\n\nInformation 3:\n### 7.8.5 Analysis of specification impacts  \nFor specification impacts from each UE complexity reduction technique,\nrefer to clauses 7.2 through 7.7.  \n8 UE power saving features\n==========================  \n8.1 Introduction to UE power saving features\n--------------------------------------------  \nThe following UE power saving techniques have been studied:  \n\\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE\nlimits  \n\\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle  \n\\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices  \nThe outcomes of the studies of these techniques are captured in clauses\n8.2 through 8.4, respectively, and summarized in clause 13.  \nIn addition, RAN2 has studied the impact of introducing RedCap UEs on UE\npower consumption in general and has observed that power consumption of\nRedCap UEs may be impacted because of paging false alarm and unnecessary\nSIB1 reading. Paging false alarm and unnecessary SIB1 reading are not\nspecific to RedCap UEs and are discussed in Rel-17 Power Saving WI.\nEnhancements introduced by Rel-17 Power Saving WI should also be\napplicable to RedCap UEs.  \n8.2 Reduced PDCCH monitoring\n----------------------------\n\nInformation 4:\nthe UE does not need to follow shorter RAN or default paging cycle, and\ntherefore has the same pros/cons: it enables a mix of smartphones and\nRedCap UEs in the network, with an appropriate paging cycle configured\nfor each of them. However, these solutions (solution 1 and eDRX with\n2.56 seconds cycle) assume such RedCap UEs do not need to monitor gNB\nconfigured default broadcasted paging (and UE-specific RAN paging)\ncycles, thus resulting in network not being able to reach such RedCap\nUEs by using default broadcasted paging cycles and/or UE-specific RAN\npaging cycles. This may result e.g. in a potential risk of UE missing SI\nchange indicator. Specifically, solution 1 requires a different way to\ndetermine the UE DRX cycle for RedCap UEs in both the UE and the gNB.  \nSolution 2 is consistent with the LTE solution, but a default\nbroadcasted DRX value of 2.56 seconds is expected not to be widely used,\ne.g. in existing deployments supporting smartphones, requiring changes\nto the paging cycle in existing deployments and configuration of a\nUE-specific paging cycle for each UE intended to follow a shorter paging\ncycle.  \nOther solutions also exist that do not consider the power saving aspects\nfor UEs receiving emergency broadcast services. For example, a simple\nsolution is that RedCap UEs that need to receive emergency broadcast\nservices do not request to be configured with eDRX, and no specific\nhandling/configuration is required for those UEs. However, such RedCap\nUEs do not benefit from any specific eDRX power saving. Alternately, a\nRedCap UE could request an eDRX configuration while still monitoring for\nETWS and CMAS in between the paging occasions.\n\nInformation 5:\nPaging Attempt Count shall be increased by one at each new paging\nattempt. The Next Paging Area Scope, when present, indicates whether the\nserving NG\\_RAN node plans to modify the RAN Paging Area currently\nselected at next paging attempt. If the UE leaves RRC\\_INACTIVE state\nthe Paging Attempt Count is reset.  \n**UE power saving for paging monitoring:** in order to reduce UE power\nconsumption due to false paging alarms, the group of UEs monitoring the\nsame PO can be further divided into multiple subgroups. With\nsubgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for paging if the\nsubgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via associated\nPEI. If a UE cannot find its subgroup ID with the PEI configurations in\na cell or if the UE is unable to monitor the associated PEI occasion\ncorresponding to its PO, it shall monitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:  \n\\- They are formed based on either CN controlled subgrouping or UE ID\nbased subgrouping;  \n\\- If CN controlled subgroup ID is not provided from AMF, UE ID based\nsubgrouping is used if supported by the UE and network;  \n\\- The RRC state (RRC\\_IDLE or RRC\\_INACTIVE state) does not impact\nwhich subgroup the UE belongs to;  \n\\- Subgrouping support for a cell is broadcast in the system information\nas one of the following: Only CN controlled subgrouping supported, only\nUE ID based subgrouping supported, or both CN controlled subgrouping and\nUE ID based subgrouping supported;  \n\\- Total number of subgroups allowed in a cell is up to 8 and represents\nthe sum of CN controlled and UE ID based subgrouping configured by the\nnetwork;  \n\\- A UE configured with CN controlled subgroup ID applies CN controlled\nsubgroup ID if the cell supports CN controlled subgrouping; otherwise,\nit derives UE ID based subgroup ID if the cell supports only UE ID based\nsubgrouping.  \nPEI associated with subgroups has the following characteristics:\n\nQuestion: How can UE power consumption due to false paging alarms be reduced? [3GPP Release 17]\nThink step by step before answering and analyze the relevant information carefully, then respond with a final answer in the format 'answer: <XXXXX>'.assistant\n\nanswer: UE power consumption due to false paging alarms can be reduced through sub-grouping of UEs monitoring the same PO (Paging Occasion), whereby each subgroup is associated with a unique subgroup ID and the group has a maximum number of subgroups (up to 8). Additionally, associated Paging Early Indication (PEI) is used to determine the subgroup ID, with options to use CN-controlled or UE-identified subgrouping, and a UE will monitor PDCCH for paging if its subgroup is paged, or monitoring in its PO if unable to find the associated PEI configuration or if in RRC_INACTIVE state."

This infrastructure is a\nvery valuable asset of 3GPP operators and could be leveraged to enable\napplication functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side\n\nInformation 2:\nused when authenticating the UE due to the nature of GBA.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<!\\-- new type definitions for different GBA procedures \\--\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"LegacyGBA\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nLegacy GBA where existing old authentication  \nframeworks are used for bootstrapping such  \n2G GBA in 3GPP, and CDMA 1x and CDMA 1xEvDo  \nin 3GPP2.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAMobileMobile\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA using AKA as specified in 3GPP and 3GPP2.  \nThe shared secret is derived in the mobile and  \nused in the mobile.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAUICCMobile\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA\\_U using AKA as specified in 3GPP and 3GPP2.  \nThe shared secret is derived in the UICC and used  \nin the mobile.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAUICCUICC\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA\\_U using AKA as specified in 3GPP and 3GPP2.  \nThe shared secret is derived in the UICC and used  \nin the UICC.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAMechanism\\\" type=\\\"GBAMechanismType\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA mechanism used in the bootstrapping procedure.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:complexType name=\\\"GBAMechanismType\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:choice\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"LegacyGBA\\\"/\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"GBAMobileMobile\\\"/\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"GBAUICCMobile\\\"/\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"GBAUICCUICC\\\"/\\>  \n\\</xs:choice\\>  \n\\</xs:complexType\\>  \n\\</xs:schema\\>  \nE.4 GBA authentication context classes\n======================================  \nE.4.1 GBAOneFactorUnregistered\n------------------------------  \nThis class reflects that there were no mobile customer registration\n\nInformation 3:\napplication functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side\nto establish shared cryptographic material based on 3GPP credentials.\nThis is the motivation and purpose of the Generic Bootstrapping\nArchitecture (GBA) and GBA Push features developed in 3GPP since Rel-6.  \nThe GBA architecture in releases prior to Rel-17 includes a\nBootstrapping Server Function (BSF) which is the anchor of the\ncryptographic key hierarchy, the Home Subscriber System (HSS), which\nhandles the user subscriptions and provides authentication vectors to\nthe BSF, UE applications and Network Application Functions (NAFs). GBA\nincludes a bootstrapping protocol for authentication and key agreement\nfor a root security key between the UE and BSF and a framework of\napplication session protocols (Ua protocols) to establish an application\nsecurity key between a UE and a NAF. The application security key is\nderived from the bootstrapping key. The GBA Push feature includes a\nprotocol between the NAF and the UE in order to establish the\napplication security key with a more efficient message exchange suitable\nfor constrained devices. GBA is specified to support at least the\nfollowing Diameter-based reference point interfaces: (a) Zh between the\nBSF and HSS for mutual authentication between the HN and the UE, (b) Zn\nbetween the BSF and NAF for the application security key establishment\nand (c) Zpn between the BSF and a GBA Push enabled NAF (Push-NAF) for a\ncombined mutual authentication and application security key\nestablishment. The use of these interfaces has allowed GBA to be used in\n3G and also in 4G core networks since the HSS in 3G and 4G supported\nDiameter-based interfaces.  \nWith the advent of 5G, the 5G Core (5GC) has introduced Network\nFunctions which expose SBA interfaces and among other network functions\na new subscription management network function, the User Data Management\n(UDM). Enabling GBA and GBA Push functionality to be used in 5GC,\n\nInformation 4:\n====================================================  \n3.1 Definitions\n---------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and\ndefinitions apply:  \n**AKA-based GBA: This term collectively refers to all GBA variants that\nmake use of a form of the AKA protocol on the Ub interface, i.e. the\nterm refers to GBA\\_ME, GBA\\_U, and 2G GBA, as defined in the present\ndocument, and to GBA\\_push as defined in TS 33.223 \\[45\\].**  \n**Application: In all places in this document where the term application\nis used to refer to a service offered by the MNO or a third party to the\nmobile subscriber, then it always denotes the type of application and\nnot the actual instance of an application installed on an application\nserver.**  \n**Bootstrapping Server Function:** BSF is hosted in a network element\nunder the control of an MNO.

The Paging Request triggers the UE Triggered\nService Request procedure in the UE. If asynchronous type communication\nis activated, the network stores the received message and forward the\nmessage to the (R)AN and/or the UE (i.e. synchronizes the context with\nthe (R)AN and/or the UE) when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state.  \nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access and if the UE is\nsimultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in a PLMN, the\nnetwork shall initiate a Network Triggered Service Request procedure\nover 3GPP access.  \nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state\nin non-3GPP access and if the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP\nand non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN, the network may initiate a\nNetwork Triggered Service Request procedure for 3GPP access via non-3GPP\naccess.  \nFor this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF are all under control of\nthe PLMN serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and\nUPF in HPLMN are not involved.  \nThe procedure below covers the following non exhaustive list of\nuse-cases for 3GPP access (detailed conditions of when the steps apply\n\nInformation 2:\n### 4.5.1 Device Triggering Function  \nDevice Triggering is the means by which a SCS sends information to the\nUE via the 3GPP network to trigger the UE to perform application\nspecific actions that include initiating communication with the SCS for\nthe indirect model or an AS in the network for the hybrid model.

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n860247       **Perf. part: UE power saving enhancements for NR**   NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh-Perf   R4   RP-212630       MediaTek  \nSummary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.  \nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of\nexperienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power\nconsumption. UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the\nsuccess of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to\naddress outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power\nconsumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption\nwith traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the\nfollowing new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:  \n\u2022 Enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging\nenhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive\nmode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in\nconnected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs  \n\u2022 Enhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH\nmonitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG)\nswitching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM\nand/or BFD in connected mode  \n**[Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in\nidle/inactive mode]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the\ngroup of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple\nsubgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for\npaging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via\nassociated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging\nprobability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption\nin idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to\nmonitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall\nmonitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n\nInformation 2:\nTRS in TRS occasions may allow UEs in RRC\\_IDLE/RRC\\_INACTIVE to sleep\nlonger before waking-up for its paging occasion. The TRS occasions\nconfiguration is provided in SIB17. The availability of TRS in the TRS\noccasions is indicated by L1 availability indication. These TRSs may\nalso be used by the UEs configured with eDRX.  \nUE power saving may be achieved by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD.\nWhen configured, UE determines whether it is in low mobility state\nand/or whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than a\nthreshold. The configuration for low mobility and good serving cell\nquality criterion is provided through dedicated RRC signalling.  \nRLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately through RRC\nConfiguration. Additionally, RLM relaxation may be enabled/disabled on\nper Cell Group basis while BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per\nserving cell basis.  \nThe UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation when relaxed\nmeasurement criterion for low mobility and/or for good serving cell\nquality is met. If configured to do so, the UE shall trigger reporting\nof its RLM and/or BFD relaxation status through UE assistance\ninformation if the UE changes its respective RLM and/or BFD relaxation\nstatus while meeting the UE minimum requirements specified in TS 38.133\n\\[13\\].  \nUE power saving may also be achieved through PDCCH monitoring adaptation\nmechanisms when configured by the network, including skipping of PDCCH\nmonitoring and Search space set group (SSSG) switching. In this case UE\ndoes not monitor PDCCH during the PDCCH skipping duration except for the\ncases as specified in TS 38.213 \\[38\\], or monitors PDCCH according to\nthe search space sets applied in SSSG.  \n12 QoS\n======  \n12.1 Overview\n-------------  \nThe **5G QoS model** is based on QoS Flows (see TS 23.501 \\[3\\]) and\nsupports both QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS\nFlows) and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate\n\nInformation 3:\n### C.3.2 UE efficiency analysis for NR positioning enhancements  \n#### C.3.2.1 Results from source \\[4\\]  \n##### C.3.2.1.1 Description of evaluation scenarios  \nThe UE efficiency is evaluated based on UE power consumption.

Before paging\nreceiving, the PSS/SSS monitoring is needed. Also RRM measurement(s),\nincluding intra- and inter-cell shall be performed.  \nThe DRX cycle for idle state / inactive state UE consists of an \\\"On\nDuration\\\" during which the UE should perform PSS/SSS monitoring, paging\nmonitoring and RRM measurement, and an \\\"Off Duration\\\" during which the\nUE can skip reception of downlink channels to save energy. It is\nillustrated in Figure 5.8.2.1.1-1.  \nTherefore the sleep ratio is determined by the length of \\\"On Duration\\\"\nand the length of one paging cycle.\n\nQuestion: What are the enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving in NR?

GSMA further defines maximum\nuplink/downlink throughput per UE and indicates that these parameters\ncould be used to offer different contract qualities in NG.116 \\[3\\].\nTherefore, this solution assumes that the maximum uplink/downlink\nthroughput for a network slice can be different for each UE based on UE\nsubscription.  \nA subscribed S-NSSAI of the UE can be associated with per Slice Maximum\nBit Rate (Slice-MBR). The subscribed Slice-MBR is stored in the UDM as\nUE subscription and provided to the SMF. The PCF may provide the\nauthorized Slice-MBR to the SMF.  \nThe Slice-MBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be\nprovided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows for all PDU sessions\nassociated with a same S-NSSAI. The SMF or PCF (if dynamic PCC is used)\nallocates the Slice-MBR to the GBR QoS Flows and the remaining bit rate\nof the Slice-MBR to the Non-GBR QoS Flows.

Figure 6.37.2-2 shows data rate control per network slice\nat RAN and UPF. For downlink/uplink data rate control per network slice\nat RAN, the RAN performs UE-AMBR enforcement as it is. For downlink data\nrate control per network slice at UPF, the UPF performs Session-AMBR\nenforcement as it is.
