In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 3:\n|                           | Steering mode, the        |           |\n|                           | Steering mode indicator   |           |\n|                           | and the Threshold values. |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering Functionality    | Indicates the applicable  | Optional  |\n|                           | traffic steering          |           |\n|                           | functionality.            |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)     | Indicates the UL and/or   | Optional  |\n|                           | DL traffic distribution   |           |\n|                           | rules between the 3GPP    |           |\n|                           | and Non-3GPP accesses     |           |\n|                           | together with associated  |           |\n|                           | parameters (when          |           |\n|                           | applicable) for the       |           |\n|                           | traffic matching the      |           |\n|                           | service data flow.        |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode indicator   | Indicates either          | Optional  |\n|                           | autonomous load-balance   |           |\n|                           | operation or              |           |\n|                           | UE-assistance operation,  |           |\n|                           | if the steering mode is   |           |\n|                           | set to                    |           |\n|                           | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".      |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Threshold values          | Indicates the threshold   | Optional  |\n|                           | value(s) for maximum RTT  |           |\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.2.2 High-level Description  \nThis steering mode, called Autonomous steering mode, provides to both\nthe UE and the UPF flexibility on the traffic splitting control in order\nto maximize the bandwidth/throughput when two accesses are applicable\nfor this traffic. For example, some traffic has high bandwidth\nrequirement, such as video service, download service, etc, the higher\nbandwidth/throughput is provided by the network, the better service\nquality can be achieved. Then the autonomous steering mode can be\napplied on these traffic for UE and UPF to flexibly adjust the weight\nfactor on both accesses in order to maximize the bandwidth/throughput.\nAdditionally, this Autonomous steering mode should only be allowed by\nthe operator when both accesses can be applied to transport the traffic,\nand from the operator point of view, high bandwidth/throughput is more\nimportant than the control on the access selection for the traffic\nsteering/switching/splitting. See Figure 6.2.2-1 for details, where one\nsingle packet flow is shown as an example for UL and DL respectively.\nThe weight factor for the traffic over each access, e.g. 30% for UL and\n50% for DL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP\naccess, as shown in the figure, is decided by the UE and the UPF\nindependently for both UL and DL, subject to link status to achieve the\nhigh bandwidth/throughput. As the weight factor for each access can be\nadjusted dynamically by the UE and the UPF, there is no need for the\nPCF/SMF to send the static weight factor values to the UE and the UPF.  \nNOTE1: It can also be considered to send the initial weight factor to\nthe UE and the UPF from the PCF/SMF. This initial value is applied at\nthe beginning of the traffic steering when the link status measurement\nhas not been started.  \nFigure 6.2.2-1: Autonomous steering mode  \nOptionally, the threshold can also be provided together with the\nAutonomous steering mode, including Maximum RTT, UL/DL Maximum Packet\n\nInformation 5:\napplicable to non-GBR SDF;  \nC\\) load balancing, the UE steers the SDF across both the 3GPP access\nand the non-3GPP access with a given precentage if both accesses are\navailable. If there is only one access available, the UE steers the SDF\nby using the available access. This steering mode is only applicable to\nnon-GBR SDF;  \nD\\) priority based, the UE steers the SDF over the access with high\npriority unless the access with high priority is congested or\nunavailable, when the UE steers the SDF over both the access with high\npriority and the access with low priority. This steering mode is only\napplicable to non-GBR SDF;or  \nE\\) redundant, the UE duplicates the traffic of an SDF on both the 3GPP\naccess and the non-3GPP access according to the following rules when\nthere is no threshold values provided in the the access selection\ndescriptor:  \n\\- if both accesses are available and the steering mode information\nfield in the access selection descriptor is set to \\\"Primary access is\nnot provided\\\", the UE shall duplicate all the traffic of the SDF on\nboth accesses;  \n\\- if both accesses are available and the steering mode information\nfield in the access selection descriptor is set to \\\"Primary access is\n3GPP\\\" or set to \\\"Primary access is non-3GPP\\\", the UE shall send all\nthe traffic of an SDF on the indicated primary access (3GPP access or\nnon-GPP access) and may dublicate the traffic on the other access, where\nhow many and which data packets are duplicated by UE on the other access\nare implementation dependent; or  \n\\- If there is only one access available, the UE shall send the traffic\nof the SDF on the available access.  \nThe redundant steering mode is applicable to both GBR SDF and non-GBR\nSDF when there is no threshold value provided in the access selection\ndescriptor. If threshold value is provided in the access selection\ndescriptor, the redundant steering mode is applicable to only non-GBR\nSDF.

Media\ncapture equipment will be connected via cabling by default, commonly\ncoaxial cabling, optical fiber, or Gigabit-Ethernet. Where it is more\nconvenient and feasible, some of the capture equipment can be connected\nwirelessly, using FLUS as foreseen in the present use case. Wireless\nconnections offer the possibility to give spectacular vantage positions\nfor the coverage, from places not easily accessible via cabling, or for\nmore flexible and rapid mobile coverage, for example from a\nshoulder-mounted camera, from a participant wearing a body-mounted\ncamera, or from mobile unmanned vehicles like drones. The minimalistic\nmedia production use case consists of a single remote camera feed that\nuplinks content via FLUS, which corresponds to the breaking news\nreporter use case above.  \nThe media production use case calls for the highest possible quality of\naudio and video content that is delivered via FLUS, but not at the\nsacrifice of reliability of delivery. For example, video content is\npreferably only lightly compressed, including only intra-frame coding.\nThis allows the most flexibility and preservation of quality with\nsubsequent production operations, for example mixing and editing.\nHowever, for practical purposes, the media production use case could\nhave several production levels available -- highly compressed, lightly\ncompressed, uncompressed. Several media formats could be defined within\neach of these production levels.  \nIn some production situations, it is necessary for the production centre\nto communicate in real time with camera personnel, to execute direction\nfor the coverage. Communication can be individually to each FLUS Source,\nand/or among all participants, both at the production centre and among\n\nInformation 4:\nrelating to media streaming should be coordinated by SA4 with SA2 and\nCT3 in the production of the associated stage 2 and stage 3\nspecifications of *Naf\\_EventExposure* services.  \n5.9 Per-application-authorization\n---------------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\nrelating to media streaming should be coordinated by SA4 with SA2 and\nCT3 in the production of the associated stage 2 and stage 3\nspecifications of *Naf\\_EventExposure* services.  \n5.9 Per-application-authorization\n---------------------------------\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Media Streaming AF Event Exposure work item?

        "answer": "option 3: To enable the UE and UPF to freely select split percentages for each access type",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nintroduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a\nsteering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and\ndownlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP\naccesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering Functionality   | Indicates the applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | traffic steering         |             |\n|                          | functionality.           |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)    | Indicates the UL and/or  | Optional    |\n|                          | DL traffic distribution  |             |\n|                          | rules between the 3GPP   |             |\n|                          | and Non-3GPP accesses    |             |\n|                          | together with associated |             |\n|                          | parameters (when         |             |\n|                          | applicable) for the      |             |\n|                          | traffic matching the     |             |\n|                          | service data flow.       |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode indicator  | Indicates either         | Optional    |\n|                          | autonomous load-balance  |             |\n|                          | operation or             |             |\n|                          | UE-assistance operation, |             |\n|                          | if the steering mode is  |             |\n|                          | set to                   |             |\n|                          | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".     |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Threshold value(s)       | Indicates, as applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | for the steering mode,   |             |\n|                          | the threshold value(s)   |             |\n|                          | for maximum RTT or       |             |\n|                          | maximum Packet Loss      |             |\n\nInformation 3:\n1\\) For the Load-Balancing steering mode:  \n\\- The network may not provide pre-defined split percentages, in which\ncase the UE and the UPF can freely and independently decide how to split\nthe traffic across the two accesses.  \nNOTE1: The above bullet covers the \\\"autonomous\\\" steering mode defined\nin Solution \\#2.

For example, if the Rel-16\nload-balancing weight factors are set to fixed rates 50% and 50% per\neach access for UL, and in the case the transport bandwidth is different\nbetween 3GPP and non3GPP, e.g. 50Mbps over 3GPP, and 100Mbps over\nnon3GPP, the UE cannot fully take advantage of 100Mbps via non 3GPP\naccess as not satisfying the fixed 50% and 50% weight factors\nrequirement.  \n2\\) Thresholds:  \nThresholds provided to the UPF may be a useful addition as proposed in\nSolution \\#2/\\#3:  \n\\- Sol\\#3 suggest that PCF provides thresholds in PCC rules and that\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of load-balancing steering mode enhancements?

        "question": "How can UE power consumption due to false paging alarms be reduced? [3GPP Release 17]",
        "answer": "option 5: By dividing UEs into multiple subgroups",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n860247       **Perf. part: UE power saving enhancements for NR**   NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh-Perf   R4   RP-212630       MediaTek  \nSummary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.  \nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of\nexperienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power\nconsumption. UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the\nsuccess of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to\naddress outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power\nconsumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption\nwith traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the\nfollowing new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:  \n\u2022 Enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging\nenhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive\nmode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in\nconnected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs  \n\u2022 Enhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH\nmonitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG)\nswitching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM\nand/or BFD in connected mode  \n**[Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in\nidle/inactive mode]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the\ngroup of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple\nsubgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for\npaging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via\nassociated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging\nprobability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption\nin idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to\nmonitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall\nmonitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n\nInformation 2:\n### 7.8.5 Analysis of specification impacts  \nFor specification impacts from each UE complexity reduction technique,\nrefer to clauses 7.2 through 7.7.  \n8 UE power saving features\n==========================  \n8.1 Introduction to UE power saving features\n--------------------------------------------  \nThe following UE power saving techniques have been studied:  \n\\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE\nlimits  \n\\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle  \n\\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices  \nThe outcomes of the studies of these techniques are captured in clauses\n8.2 through 8.4, respectively, and summarized in clause 13.  \nIn addition, RAN2 has studied the impact of introducing RedCap UEs on UE\npower consumption in general and has observed that power consumption of\nRedCap UEs may be impacted because of paging false alarm and unnecessary\nSIB1 reading. Paging false alarm and unnecessary SIB1 reading are not\nspecific to RedCap UEs and are discussed in Rel-17 Power Saving WI.\nEnhancements introduced by Rel-17 Power Saving WI should also be\napplicable to RedCap UEs.  \n8.2 Reduced PDCCH monitoring\n----------------------------\n\nInformation 3:\na factor of total PO number associated with up to two paging frames\n(PFs).  \n\u2022 The time location of PEI-O for UE\\'s PO is determined by a reference\npoint and a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the start of\nthe first PDCCH monitoring occasion of this PEI-O. The reference point\nis the start of a reference frame determined by a frame-level offset\nfrom the start of the first PF of the PF(s) associated with the PEI-O.\nThe time location of PEI-O can be configured so that total UE reception\npower consumption in idle/inactive mode, including synchronization and\nRRM measurements, can be minimized.  \n**[Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected\nmode to idle/inactive-mode UEs]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to synchronization for\npaging receptions, RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive\nUE(s) can be provided via system information (SIB17). By exploiting TRS\nfor synchronization, UE can reduce the number of wake-up for SSB before\na paging reception and potentially achieve longer sleep. It is noticed\nthat RS configuration in SIB17 does not affect the UE behaviour in\nCONNECTED mode and can be ignored by UE in CONNECTED mode.  \nThe maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is\n64. If a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability\nindication is always enabled based on that configuration. A UE which\nacquired SIB17 with a TRS configuration but did not yet receive an\nassociated L1-based availability indication considers the configured TRS\nas unavailable. The L1 availability indication is carried in a DCI\nformat 2\\_7, if configured, and a DCI format 1\\_0 with CRC scrambled by\nP-RNTI. The TRS availability indication field in the DCI format(s)\nprovides a bitmap for up to 6 groups of TRS resource sets where the\nconfiguration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit\nof the bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a validity duration\n\nInformation 4:\nthe UE does not need to follow shorter RAN or default paging cycle, and\ntherefore has the same pros/cons: it enables a mix of smartphones and\nRedCap UEs in the network, with an appropriate paging cycle configured\nfor each of them. However, these solutions (solution 1 and eDRX with\n2.56 seconds cycle) assume such RedCap UEs do not need to monitor gNB\nconfigured default broadcasted paging (and UE-specific RAN paging)\ncycles, thus resulting in network not being able to reach such RedCap\nUEs by using default broadcasted paging cycles and/or UE-specific RAN\npaging cycles. This may result e.g. in a potential risk of UE missing SI\nchange indicator. Specifically, solution 1 requires a different way to\ndetermine the UE DRX cycle for RedCap UEs in both the UE and the gNB.  \nSolution 2 is consistent with the LTE solution, but a default\nbroadcasted DRX value of 2.56 seconds is expected not to be widely used,\ne.g. in existing deployments supporting smartphones, requiring changes\nto the paging cycle in existing deployments and configuration of a\nUE-specific paging cycle for each UE intended to follow a shorter paging\ncycle.  \nOther solutions also exist that do not consider the power saving aspects\nfor UEs receiving emergency broadcast services. For example, a simple\nsolution is that RedCap UEs that need to receive emergency broadcast\nservices do not request to be configured with eDRX, and no specific\nhandling/configuration is required for those UEs. However, such RedCap\nUEs do not benefit from any specific eDRX power saving. Alternately, a\nRedCap UE could request an eDRX configuration while still monitoring for\nETWS and CMAS in between the paging occasions.\n\nInformation 5:\nue-Identity) for the UE and ensures the UE is in State 3A according to\n3GPP TS 36.508 \\[7\\] clause 4.5.3A (if the paging fails, switches off\nand on the UE and ensures the UE is in State 3A-RF according to 3GPP TS\n36.508 \\[7\\] clause 7.2A.3); or  \n\\- switches off and on the UE and ensures the UE is in State 3A-RF\naccording to 3GPP TS 36.508 \\[7\\] clause7.2A.3.  \n> 13\\.

One source\nprovides a plot of possible UE battery lifetime against eDRX cycle\nlength. The battery lifetime for a UE with a 2-minute eDRX cycle\ncompared to the same device with 10.24 seconds eDRX cycle is shown to\nresult in between 0.38 -- 340 % improvements for RRC\\_IDLE and 1-419 %\nimprovements for RRC\\_INACTIVE, respectively. The evaluation has been\nperformed for various use cases and inter-arrival times from 100 ms up\nto 5 minutes.  \nFrom RAN2 perspective, extended DRX is beneficial for UE power\nconsumption and can be specified and configured for RedCap UEs so that\neDRX cycles can be used in RRC\\_IDLE and in RRC\\_INACTIVE states.  \nRAN2 sees a benefit extending the eDRX cycle in RRC\\_INACTIVE beyond\n10.24 seconds for RedCap UEs for the following reasons:  \n\\- It is very beneficial to have eDRX cycles \\>10.24 seconds in\nRRC\\_INACTIVE to effectively support the use of Rel-17 SDT (small data\ntransmission) e.g. for use cases with periodic uplink data with\nperiodicity \\> 10.24 seconds. TS 22.104 provides such use cases, e.g.\nsome industrial wireless sensors need to transfer small packets and have\nstrict battery lifetime requirements, while not being sensitive to DL\ntraffic delay.  \n\\- Based on the results in Annex E.1, there is a clear power saving gain\nvs eDRX in RRC\\_IDLE at least for eDRX cycles in the range from 10.24\nseconds up to couple of minutes, where the UE in eDRX in RRC\\_INACTIVE\nadditionally benefits from less signaling. Based on these results,\nlifetime of several years would not be achievable in some cases (e.g.\n\nQuestion: What are the enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving in NR?

The procedure uses an averaging window over a\nspecified time period \\'T\\' such that an average over the given time\nperiod is calculated. This gives a smoothing effect such that clients\nthat need to send one or more large packets, for example for a large I\nframe, have time to compensate for this by sending smaller packets\nafterwards.  \nThe solution defines the time period that is used in somewhat different\nways depending on whether the entity is generating media or whether the\nentity is monitoring the media:  \n\\- Entities generating media, e.g. codecs, should generate packets such\nthat the average bitrate measured over a time period \\'Te\\' that is\nshorter than or equal to T.  \n\\- Entities monitoring the media, e.g. policing functions, should\ncalculate the average bitrate over a time period that \\'Tp\\' that is\nlonger than or equal to T.  \nThe length of the averaging window \\'T\\' is proposed to be 2 seconds for\nMBR calculation (see Annex A).  \nNOTE: It will be determined during the normative phase of the work\nwhether the recommended 2sec averaging window also applies to the GBR.  \nThis solution does not use any signalling between clients and networks,\nor between different networks nodes.

One or more\nRAN nodes of the PLMN with Disaster Condition are non-operational.  \n\\- Architecture defined in 3GPPTS23.501\\[4\\] is used as basis\narchitecture for supporting minimization of service interruption.  \n4.2 Architectural Requirements\n------------------------------  \nThe system shall satisfy the stage-1 requirements in TS22.261\\[3\\]\nclause6.31 and TS22.011\\[2\\] clause3.2.2.  \nThe solution shall enable a UE of a selected PLMN (HPLMN or VPLMN) with\nDisaster Condition, to select and register on another PLMN without\nDisaster Condition in UE\\'s forbidden PLMN list when no other PLMN is\navailable except for PLMNs in UE\\'s forbidden PLMN list and the PLMN\nwithout Disaster Condition is able to accept Disaster Inbound Roamers\nfrom the PLMN with Disaster Condition.  \nIf the UE, with HPLMN subscription, was informed by the HPLMN that it\nshould apply Disaster Roaming when a Disaster Condition arises (in the\nHPLMN or a VPLMN), the solution shall enable a UE to detect that a\nDisaster Condition applies to PLMN D, where PLMN D is the UE\\'s HPLMN or\n\nInformation 3:\nterm, if any, in 3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\].  \n**Disaster Condition:** This is the condition that a government decides\nwhether it is applicable or not based on, e.g. a natural disaster or a\nman-made disaster. When this condition applies, users may have the\nopportunity to mitigate service interruptions and failures.  \n**Disaster Roaming:** This is the special type of roaming service that\napplies during a Disaster Condition.  \n**Disaster Inbound Roamers:** Users that (a) cannot get service from the\nPLMN they would normally be served by, due to failure of service during\na Disaster Condition, and (b) are able to register with other PLMNs.  \n3.2 Abbreviations\n-----------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in\n3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in\nthe present document takes precedence over the definition of the same\nabbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\].  \n4 Overview\n==========  \nMobile communication service has become essential part of our society.\nFor example, mobile payment or ride-sharing service cannot work without\nmobile connectivity. Thus, it is important that users of mobile\ncommunication service get their subscribed services without being\ninterrupted.  \nHowever, disasters can cause interruption of communication services,\ne.g.:  \n> \\- Natural disasters such as earthquake can cause fire or power outage\n> to some radio access network equipment. These in turn lead to abrupt\n> disappearance of cells or no routing among radio access network and\n> core network.\n>\n> \\- Human-made disasters such as installation of software with bugs or\n> ill-managed certificate can cause abnormal behaviour of a radio access\n> network. Subscribed UEs of the network cannot exchanges signalling or\n> data.  \nBecause resulting impact on business and society is huge, it is utmost\nimportant to minimize the time and area where connectivity service is\ninterrupted due to disaster.  \n5 Use cases\n===========\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.4.1 Description  \nWhen the UE of a PLMN with Disaster Condition is notified of Disaster\nCondition, according to conclusion of the Key Issue \\#1, and the UE\nselects the other PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service, then the UE\nshall perform the registration procedure in order to be registered to\nthe PLMN. It is unclear how the Disaster Roaming PLMN authenticates the\nUE and how to collect charging information when the Disaster Condition\napplies.  \nAccording to 3GPPTS22.261\\[3\\] clause 6.31.2.3:  \n3GPP system shall be able to collect charging information for a Disaster\nInbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition  \nAccording to 3GPPTS22.261\\[3\\] clause 6.31.2.2:  \nThe 3GPP system shall be able to support provision of service to\nDisaster Inbound Roamer only within the specific region where Disaster\nCondition applies.  \nAs per this service requirement quoted, the Disaster Roaming PLMN shall\nbe able to consider the area of service to Disaster Inbound Roamers that\nis limited to the region where Disaster Condition applies.  \nThe following questions are expected to be studied within this Key\nIssue:  \n\\- How a registration procedure initiated by Inbound Disaster Roamer is\nperformed;  \n\\- How to authenticate Inbound Disaster Roamer during the registration\nprocedure;  \n\\- Which network functions or entities are involved for the registration\nprocedure of Disaster Inbound Roamers;  \n\\- How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound\nDisaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies;  \n\\- How and which function to collect charging information for a Disaster\nInbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition;\nand  \n\\- What other information, if any, is needed to be transferred between\nthe UE and the network during the initial registration procedure.  \n5.5 Key issue \\#5: PLMN selection when a \\\"Disaster Condition\\\" applies\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\n\\[CPR-C-003\\] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a resource\nefficient means for a PLMN to indicate to potential Disaster Inbound\nRoamers whether they can access the PLMN or not.  \n\\[CPR-C-004\\] The Disaster Inbound Roamers shall perform network\nreselection when a Disaster Condition has ended.  \n\\[CPR-D-001\\] The 3GPP system shall minimize congestion caused by\nDisaster Roaming.  \n\\[CPR-E-001\\] The 3GPP system shall be able to collect charging\ninformation for a Disaster Inbound Roamer with information about the\napplied disaster condition.  \n7 Conclusions and Recommendations\n=================================  \nThis document analyses a number of use cases to minimize potential\nservice interruption that may be caused when natural or human-made\ndisaster hits. The resulting potential requirements have been\nconsolidated in clause 6. Additionally, it is recommended to include the\nterminology introduced in this TR to TS 22.261, for aid in expressing\nand understanding the Minimization of Service Interruption requirements  \nIt is recommended that the consolidated potential requirements\nidentified in this TR are considered as the basis of normative\nrequirements in order to better serve the communication services.  \n#########  Annex A: Change history  \n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n| **C   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| hange |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| hist  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| ory** |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n| **D   | *     | **T   | *     | **    | **    | **Su  | **New |\n| ate** | *Meet | Doc** | *CR** | Rev** | Cat** | bject | vers  |\n|       | ing** |       |       |       |       | /Comm | ion** |\n|       |       |       |       |       |       | ent** |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n\nQuestion: What aspects of the Disaster Roaming service are specified in TS 22.011 and TS 22.261?
