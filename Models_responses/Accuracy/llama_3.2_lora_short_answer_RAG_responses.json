Event-triggered inter-system load reports are sent when the\nreporting node detects crossing of cell load thresholds.  \nThe following load related information should be supported which\nconsists of:  \n\\- Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);  \n\\- Capacity value (per cell: UL/DL available capacity);  \n\\- RRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC\nConnection Capacity);  \n\\- Number of active UEs;  \n\\- Radio Resource Status (per cell PRB usage: UL/DL GBR PRB usage, DL/UL\nnon-GBR PRB usage, DL/UL total PRB usage, and DL/UL ***scheduling PDCCH\nCCE usage***).  \nNGAP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are Uplink RAN\nConfiguration Transfer and Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer.  \nS1AP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are eNB\nConfiguration Transfer and MME Configuration Transfer.  \n#### 22.4.1.3 Load balancing action based on handovers  \nThe source cell may initiate handover due to load (see clauses 10.1.2\nand 10.2.2). The target cell performs admission control for the load\nbalancing handovers. A handover preparation related to a mobility load\nbalancing action shall be distinguishable from other handovers, so that\nthe target cell is able to apply appropriate admission control.  \n#### 22.4.1.4 Adapting handover and/or reselection configuration  \nThis function enables requesting of a change of handover and/or\nreselection parameters at target cell.

In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering Functionality   | Indicates the applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | traffic steering         |             |\n|                          | functionality.           |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)    | Indicates the UL and/or  | Optional    |\n|                          | DL traffic distribution  |             |\n|                          | rules between the 3GPP   |             |\n|                          | and Non-3GPP accesses    |             |\n|                          | together with associated |             |\n|                          | parameters (when         |             |\n|                          | applicable) for the      |             |\n|                          | traffic matching the     |             |\n|                          | service data flow.       |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode indicator  | Indicates either         | Optional    |\n|                          | autonomous load-balance  |             |\n|                          | operation or             |             |\n|                          | UE-assistance operation, |             |\n|                          | if the steering mode is  |             |\n|                          | set to                   |             |\n|                          | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".     |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Threshold value(s)       | Indicates, as applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | for the steering mode,   |             |\n|                          | the threshold value(s)   |             |\n|                          | for maximum RTT or       |             |\n|                          | maximum Packet Loss      |             |\n\nInformation 3:\napplicable to non-GBR SDF;  \nC\\) load balancing, the UE steers the SDF across both the 3GPP access\nand the non-3GPP access with a given precentage if both accesses are\navailable.

If the steering functionality is set to ATSSS-LL functionality, the\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.2.2 High-level Description  \nThis steering mode, called Autonomous steering mode, provides to both\nthe UE and the UPF flexibility on the traffic splitting control in order\nto maximize the bandwidth/throughput when two accesses are applicable\nfor this traffic. For example, some traffic has high bandwidth\nrequirement, such as video service, download service, etc, the higher\nbandwidth/throughput is provided by the network, the better service\nquality can be achieved. Then the autonomous steering mode can be\napplied on these traffic for UE and UPF to flexibly adjust the weight\nfactor on both accesses in order to maximize the bandwidth/throughput.\nAdditionally, this Autonomous steering mode should only be allowed by\nthe operator when both accesses can be applied to transport the traffic,\nand from the operator point of view, high bandwidth/throughput is more\nimportant than the control on the access selection for the traffic\nsteering/switching/splitting. See Figure 6.2.2-1 for details, where one\nsingle packet flow is shown as an example for UL and DL respectively.\nThe weight factor for the traffic over each access, e.g. 30% for UL and\n50% for DL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP\naccess, as shown in the figure, is decided by the UE and the UPF\nindependently for both UL and DL, subject to link status to achieve the\nhigh bandwidth/throughput. As the weight factor for each access can be\nadjusted dynamically by the UE and the UPF, there is no need for the\nPCF/SMF to send the static weight factor values to the UE and the UPF.  \nNOTE1: It can also be considered to send the initial weight factor to\nthe UE and the UPF from the PCF/SMF. This initial value is applied at\nthe beginning of the traffic steering when the link status measurement\nhas not been started.  \nFigure 6.2.2-1: Autonomous steering mode  \nOptionally, the threshold can also be provided together with the\nAutonomous steering mode, including Maximum RTT, UL/DL Maximum Packet\n\nInformation 5:\n|                           | Steering mode, the        |           |\n|                           | Steering mode indicator   |           |\n|                           | and the Threshold values. |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering Functionality    | Indicates the applicable  | Optional  |\n|                           | traffic steering          |           |\n|                           | functionality.            |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)     | Indicates the UL and/or   | Optional  |\n|                           | DL traffic distribution   |           |\n|                           | rules between the 3GPP    |           |\n|                           | and Non-3GPP accesses     |           |\n|                           | together with associated  |           |\n|                           | parameters (when          |           |\n|                           | applicable) for the       |           |\n|                           | traffic matching the      |           |\n|                           | service data flow.        |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode indicator   | Indicates either          | Optional  |\n|                           | autonomous load-balance   |           |\n|                           | operation or              |           |\n|                           | UE-assistance operation,  |           |\n|                           | if the steering mode is   |           |\n|                           | set to                    |           |\n|                           | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".      |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Threshold values          | Indicates the threshold   | Optional  |\n|                           | value(s) for maximum RTT  |           |\n\nQuestion: What does the Load-Balancing steering mode do?

This information can be of interest\nto the 5GMS Application Provider or to other Network Functions in the 5G\nSytem.  \nThe following extensions (Stage 2 and Stage 3) are recommended:  \n\\- Identify and define the media-related data to be exposed by the 5GMS\nAF towards the 5G System and other event consumer entities. Work with\nother 3GPP groups for carriage in existing AF events or the definition\nof new AF Events.  \n\\- Enhance the 5GMS AF data collection to support direct and indirect\ncollection of UE data pertaining to media sessions.  \n\\- Devise mechanisms to control the access to the collected media\nsession data.  \n\\- Define a generic architecture within which media-specific solutions\nfor the configuration and subsequent operation of data collection and\ndata reporting (via event exposure) by the AF can be specified.  \n6.9 Per-application-authorization\n---------------------------------  \nThe 5G Media Streaming Architecture enables a 5GMS-Aware Application to\naccess certain network features, in alignment with the 5GMS Application\nProvider. The Key Issue explores the usage of OAuth 2.0 for\nper-application authorization of different 5G System features, for\nexample to prevent misuse. The Key Issue specifically addresses\nuse-cases, when a UE hosts multiple 5GMS-Aware Applications from\ndifferent 5GMS Application Providers.  \nIt is recommended to specify the usage of OAuth 2.0 (according to the\nSA3 guidelines) within a normative work item.  \n6.10 Support for encrypted and high-value content\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.8.1 Description  \n#### 5.8.1.1 Events exposed by 5GMS AF  \nThe 5GMS AF performs several critical support operations for media\nstreaming sessions.

In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering Functionality   | Indicates the applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | traffic steering         |             |\n|                          | functionality.           |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)    | Indicates the UL and/or  | Optional    |\n|                          | DL traffic distribution  |             |\n|                          | rules between the 3GPP   |             |\n|                          | and Non-3GPP accesses    |             |\n|                          | together with associated |             |\n|                          | parameters (when         |             |\n|                          | applicable) for the      |             |\n|                          | traffic matching the     |             |\n|                          | service data flow.       |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Steering mode indicator  | Indicates either         | Optional    |\n|                          | autonomous load-balance  |             |\n|                          | operation or             |             |\n|                          | UE-assistance operation, |             |\n|                          | if the steering mode is  |             |\n|                          | set to                   |             |\n|                          | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".     |             |\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+\n| Threshold value(s)       | Indicates, as applicable | Optional    |\n|                          | for the steering mode,   |             |\n|                          | the threshold value(s)   |             |\n|                          | for maximum RTT or       |             |\n|                          | maximum Packet Loss      |             |\n\nInformation 3:\n### 6.2.2 High-level Description  \nThis steering mode, called Autonomous steering mode, provides to both\nthe UE and the UPF flexibility on the traffic splitting control in order\nto maximize the bandwidth/throughput when two accesses are applicable\nfor this traffic. For example, some traffic has high bandwidth\nrequirement, such as video service, download service, etc, the higher\nbandwidth/throughput is provided by the network, the better service\nquality can be achieved. Then the autonomous steering mode can be\napplied on these traffic for UE and UPF to flexibly adjust the weight\nfactor on both accesses in order to maximize the bandwidth/throughput.\nAdditionally, this Autonomous steering mode should only be allowed by\nthe operator when both accesses can be applied to transport the traffic,\nand from the operator point of view, high bandwidth/throughput is more\nimportant than the control on the access selection for the traffic\nsteering/switching/splitting. See Figure 6.2.2-1 for details, where one\nsingle packet flow is shown as an example for UL and DL respectively.\nThe weight factor for the traffic over each access, e.g. 30% for UL and\n50% for DL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP\naccess, as shown in the figure, is decided by the UE and the UPF\nindependently for both UL and DL, subject to link status to achieve the\nhigh bandwidth/throughput. As the weight factor for each access can be\nadjusted dynamically by the UE and the UPF, there is no need for the\nPCF/SMF to send the static weight factor values to the UE and the UPF.  \nNOTE1: It can also be considered to send the initial weight factor to\nthe UE and the UPF from the PCF/SMF. This initial value is applied at\nthe beginning of the traffic steering when the link status measurement\nhas not been started.  \nFigure 6.2.2-1: Autonomous steering mode  \nOptionally, the threshold can also be provided together with the\nAutonomous steering mode, including Maximum RTT, UL/DL Maximum Packet\n\nInformation 4:\n|                           | Steering mode, the        |           |\n|                           | Steering mode indicator   |           |\n|                           | and the Threshold values. |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering Functionality    | Indicates the applicable  | Optional  |\n|                           | traffic steering          |           |\n|                           | functionality.            |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode (UL/DL)     | Indicates the UL and/or   | Optional  |\n|                           | DL traffic distribution   |           |\n|                           | rules between the 3GPP    |           |\n|                           | and Non-3GPP accesses     |           |\n|                           | together with associated  |           |\n|                           | parameters (when          |           |\n|                           | applicable) for the       |           |\n|                           | traffic matching the      |           |\n|                           | service data flow.        |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Steering mode indicator   | Indicates either          | Optional  |\n|                           | autonomous load-balance   |           |\n|                           | operation or              |           |\n|                           | UE-assistance operation,  |           |\n|                           | if the steering mode is   |           |\n|                           | set to                    |           |\n|                           | \\\"LOAD\\_BALANCING\\\".      |           |\n+---------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+\n| Threshold values          | Indicates the threshold   | Optional  |\n|                           | value(s) for maximum RTT  |           |\n\nInformation 5:\n1\\) For the Load-Balancing steering mode:  \n\\- The network may not provide pre-defined split percentages, in which\ncase the UE and the UPF can freely and independently decide how to split\nthe traffic across the two accesses.  \nNOTE1: The above bullet covers the \\\"autonomous\\\" steering mode defined\nin Solution \\#2. Whether and how to provide an initial weight factors\nfor two accesses are to be decided during normative work.  \n2\\) For all steering modes that will be considered in the normative\nphase:  \n\\- The network may provide a UE-assistance indication, which indicates\nthat (a) the UE can decide how to distribute the UL traffic based on its\ninternal state (e.g. battery level), and (b) the UE can request from UPF\nto apply the same distribution for the DL traffic, and the UPF can take\nthe UE\\'s request into account when deciding the DL transmission traffic\ndistribution.  \n\\- The UE requests from UPF to apply the same distribution for the DL\ntraffic by using the PMF protocol, if available, or another mechanism,\nif the PMF protocol is not available. This other mechanism will be\ndetermined during the normative phase of the work.  \n3\\) For the Load-Balancing steering mode with fixed weights, and\nPriority-based steering mode:  \n\\- It shall be possible to apply a threshold condition, which indicates\nwhether a measured parameter is above or below a threshold.  \n\\- A threshold condition specifies details about how the steering mode\nshould be applied. For example, if the threshold condition \\\"RTT \\<\n100ms\\\" is applied to a Load-Balancing steering mode, it indicates that\ntraffic can be transferred on 3GPP or non-3GPP access if the measured\nRTT of this access is less than 100ms.  \n\\- The measured parameter in a threshold condition may include (a) the\nRTT (derived from PDB) and (b) the Packet Loss Rate (derived from the\nMaximum Packet Loss Rate (MPLR) or the PER).  \n\\- The threshold conditions will be the same for both 3GPP and non-3GPP\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of load-balancing steering mode enhancements?

The VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability\nenablement server  \n2\\.

The VAL server is subscribed to and received prediction of UE\nlocation change  \nFigure 9.9.2.1-1: Support for predictive slice modification in\ndistributed NSCE server deployments  \n1\\.

The support\nof network slicing relies on the principle that traffic for different\nslices is handled by different PDU sessions. Network can realise the\ndifferent network slices by scheduling and also by providing different\nL1/L2 configurations.  \nEach network slice is uniquely identified by a S-NSSAI, as defined in TS\n23.501 \\[3\\]. NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information)\nincludes one or a list of S-NSSAIs (Single NSSAI) where a S-NSSAI is a\ncombination of:  \n\\- mandatory SST (Slice/Service Type) field, which identifies the slice\ntype and consists of 8 bits (with range is 0-255);  \n\\- optional SD (Slice Differentiator) field, which differentiates among\nSlices with same SST field and consist of 24 bits.  \nThe list includes at most 8 S-NSSAI(s).  \nThe UE provides NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information)\nfor network slice selection in *RRCSetupComplete*, if it has been\nprovided by NAS (see clause 9.2.1.3). While the network can support\nlarge number of slices (hundreds), the UE need not support more than 8\nslices simultaneously. A BL UE or a NB-IoT UE supports a maximum of 8\nslices simultaneously.  \nNetwork Slicing is a concept to allow differentiated treatment depending\non each customer requirements. With slicing, it is possible for Mobile\nNetwork Operators (MNO) to consider customers as belonging to different\ntenant types with each having different service requirements that govern\nin terms of what slice types each tenant is eligible to use based on\nService Level Agreement (SLA) and subscriptions.  \nThe following key principles apply for support of Network Slicing in\nNG-RAN:  \n**RAN awareness of slices**\n\nInformation 4:\n### 4.3.3 Service Cardinality  \na\\) One NSCE server may enable one or more Network slice(s) identified\nby S-NSSAI(s);  \nb\\) One Network slice can only be enabled and served by one NSCE server.  \nc\\) The NSCE servers may provide service in the same or in different\nTracking Areas.  \n5 Key issues\n============  \n5.1 Key issue 1: Network slice capability management enhancements\n-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nSEAL is the service enabler architecture layer common to all vertical\napplications over 3GPP systems. It provides the functions like location\nmanagement, group management, configuration management, identity\nmanagement, key management, network resource management and network\nslice capability management as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 \\[2\\].  \nNetwork slicing is a general network capability which can be applied for\nmany vertical industries. The network slice capability management\nservice in 3GPP TS 23.434 \\[2\\] only provides capability of network\nslice adaptation between NSCE server and the NSCE client. However, for\nsuch capability both control plane and management plane interactions\nneed to be considered since there is close coupling between the per UE\nsession and the per slice related actions. For example, the SEAL/NSCE\nlayer may need to be aware of the slice provisioning parameters\n(NSI/NSSI configuration) which can be provided by the slice management\nsystem. Furthermore, NSI/NSSI performance monitoring from management\nsystem (e.g. NSI/ NSSI status) may be useful to be known at the enabler\nlayer, since this may affect the application to slice re-mapping\ntriggering (e.g. to re-map to the least congested slice); and may also\nimpact other SEAL provided functionalities (e.g. QoS/resource control,\ngroup management etc).  \nOpen issues:  \n\\- Whether and which enhancement to SEAL network slice capability\nmanagement service is required having in mind SA2 and SA5 slice related\nexposure?\n\nInformation 5:\nconfiguration, the common RACH configuration can be used.  \n*Support service continuity*  \nIn order to support service continuity for specific slice(s), the NG-RAN\nnode may use Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing or Resource Repartitioning\nto allocate resources to a slice in case of slice resources shortage.  \nIn Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing the RAN node can setup the dual\nconnectivity or carrier aggregation with different frequency and\noverlapping coverage where the same slice is available.  \nThe Resource Repartitioning allows a slice to use resources from the\nshared pool or/and prioritized pool when its own dedicated or\nprioritized resources are not available and the use of unused resources\nin the prioritized pool is as specified in TS 28.541.  \nSlice RRM policies/restrictions associated with Resource Repartitioning\nare configured from O&M.  \nMeasurements of RRM policy utilization according to resource types\ndefined in TS 28.541 are reported from RAN nodes to O&M and may lead O&M\nto update the configuration of the Slice RRM policies/restrictions.  \n*Support the enforcement of Slice MBR and the usage of Target NSSAI*  \nThe UE-Slice MBR is introduced to limit the aggregate bit rate that can\nbe expected to be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows\ncorresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) as\nspecified in TS 23.501 and is ensured by the RAN.  \nIn case of Dual Connectivity, the MN decides the DL UE Slice MBR and UL\nUE Slice MBR limits to be assigned to the SN, and indicates these to the\nSN. In addition, the PDCP entity at the SN applies the received DL UE\nSlice MBR limit to the set of all bearers for which the SN hosts PDCP\nfor the concerned Slice, as defined in TS 23.501, and the MAC entity at\nthe SN applies the received UL UE Slice MBR limit to the scheduled\nuplink radio traffic at the SN for the concerned Slice, as defined in TS\n23.501.  \nIn order to support the enforcement of Slice MBR, RAN interfaces\n\nQuestion: How is service continuity supported for specific slice(s)?

UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the\nsuccess of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to\naddress outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power\nconsumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption\nwith traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the\nfollowing new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:  \n\u2022 Enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging\nenhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive\nmode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in\nconnected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs  \n\u2022 Enhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH\nmonitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG)\nswitching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM\nand/or BFD in connected mode  \n**[Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in\nidle/inactive mode]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the\ngroup of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple\nsubgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for\npaging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via\nassociated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging\nprobability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption\nin idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to\nmonitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall\nmonitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n\nInformation 2:\na factor of total PO number associated with up to two paging frames\n(PFs).  \n\u2022 The time location of PEI-O for UE\\'s PO is determined by a reference\npoint and a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the start of\nthe first PDCCH monitoring occasion of this PEI-O. The reference point\nis the start of a reference frame determined by a frame-level offset\nfrom the start of the first PF of the PF(s) associated with the PEI-O.\nThe time location of PEI-O can be configured so that total UE reception\npower consumption in idle/inactive mode, including synchronization and\nRRM measurements, can be minimized.  \n**[Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected\nmode to idle/inactive-mode UEs]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to synchronization for\npaging receptions, RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive\nUE(s) can be provided via system information (SIB17). By exploiting TRS\nfor synchronization, UE can reduce the number of wake-up for SSB before\na paging reception and potentially achieve longer sleep. It is noticed\nthat RS configuration in SIB17 does not affect the UE behaviour in\nCONNECTED mode and can be ignored by UE in CONNECTED mode.  \nThe maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is\n64. If a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability\nindication is always enabled based on that configuration. A UE which\nacquired SIB17 with a TRS configuration but did not yet receive an\nassociated L1-based availability indication considers the configured TRS\nas unavailable. The L1 availability indication is carried in a DCI\nformat 2\\_7, if configured, and a DCI format 1\\_0 with CRC scrambled by\nP-RNTI. The TRS availability indication field in the DCI format(s)\nprovides a bitmap for up to 6 groups of TRS resource sets where the\nconfiguration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit\nof the bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a validity duration\n\nInformation 3:\n### 7.8.5 Analysis of specification impacts  \nFor specification impacts from each UE complexity reduction technique,\nrefer to clauses 7.2 through 7.7.  \n8 UE power saving features\n==========================  \n8.1 Introduction to UE power saving features\n--------------------------------------------  \nThe following UE power saving techniques have been studied:  \n\\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE\nlimits  \n\\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle  \n\\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices  \nThe outcomes of the studies of these techniques are captured in clauses\n8.2 through 8.4, respectively, and summarized in clause 13.  \nIn addition, RAN2 has studied the impact of introducing RedCap UEs on UE\npower consumption in general and has observed that power consumption of\nRedCap UEs may be impacted because of paging false alarm and unnecessary\nSIB1 reading. Paging false alarm and unnecessary SIB1 reading are not\nspecific to RedCap UEs and are discussed in Rel-17 Power Saving WI.\nEnhancements introduced by Rel-17 Power Saving WI should also be\napplicable to RedCap UEs.  \n8.2 Reduced PDCCH monitoring\n----------------------------\n\nInformation 4:\nthe UE does not need to follow shorter RAN or default paging cycle, and\ntherefore has the same pros/cons: it enables a mix of smartphones and\nRedCap UEs in the network, with an appropriate paging cycle configured\nfor each of them. However, these solutions (solution 1 and eDRX with\n2.56 seconds cycle) assume such RedCap UEs do not need to monitor gNB\nconfigured default broadcasted paging (and UE-specific RAN paging)\ncycles, thus resulting in network not being able to reach such RedCap\nUEs by using default broadcasted paging cycles and/or UE-specific RAN\npaging cycles. This may result e.g. in a potential risk of UE missing SI\nchange indicator. Specifically, solution 1 requires a different way to\ndetermine the UE DRX cycle for RedCap UEs in both the UE and the gNB.  \nSolution 2 is consistent with the LTE solution, but a default\nbroadcasted DRX value of 2.56 seconds is expected not to be widely used,\ne.g. in existing deployments supporting smartphones, requiring changes\nto the paging cycle in existing deployments and configuration of a\nUE-specific paging cycle for each UE intended to follow a shorter paging\ncycle.  \nOther solutions also exist that do not consider the power saving aspects\nfor UEs receiving emergency broadcast services. For example, a simple\nsolution is that RedCap UEs that need to receive emergency broadcast\nservices do not request to be configured with eDRX, and no specific\nhandling/configuration is required for those UEs. However, such RedCap\nUEs do not benefit from any specific eDRX power saving. Alternately, a\nRedCap UE could request an eDRX configuration while still monitoring for\nETWS and CMAS in between the paging occasions.\n\nInformation 5:\nPaging Attempt Count shall be increased by one at each new paging\nattempt. The Next Paging Area Scope, when present, indicates whether the\nserving NG\\_RAN node plans to modify the RAN Paging Area currently\nselected at next paging attempt. If the UE leaves RRC\\_INACTIVE state\nthe Paging Attempt Count is reset.  \n**UE power saving for paging monitoring:** in order to reduce UE power\nconsumption due to false paging alarms, the group of UEs monitoring the\nsame PO can be further divided into multiple subgroups. With\nsubgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for paging if the\nsubgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via associated\nPEI. If a UE cannot find its subgroup ID with the PEI configurations in\na cell or if the UE is unable to monitor the associated PEI occasion\ncorresponding to its PO, it shall monitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:  \n\\- They are formed based on either CN controlled subgrouping or UE ID\nbased subgrouping;  \n\\- If CN controlled subgroup ID is not provided from AMF, UE ID based\nsubgrouping is used if supported by the UE and network;  \n\\- The RRC state (RRC\\_IDLE or RRC\\_INACTIVE state) does not impact\nwhich subgroup the UE belongs to;  \n\\- Subgrouping support for a cell is broadcast in the system information\nas one of the following: Only CN controlled subgrouping supported, only\nUE ID based subgrouping supported, or both CN controlled subgrouping and\nUE ID based subgrouping supported;  \n\\- Total number of subgroups allowed in a cell is up to 8 and represents\nthe sum of CN controlled and UE ID based subgrouping configured by the\nnetwork;  \n\\- A UE configured with CN controlled subgroup ID applies CN controlled\nsubgroup ID if the cell supports CN controlled subgrouping; otherwise,\nit derives UE ID based subgroup ID if the cell supports only UE ID based\nsubgrouping.  \nPEI associated with subgroups has the following characteristics:\n\nQuestion: How can UE power consumption due to false paging alarms be reduced?

In this way GBA can be used in 5GC deployments.  \nThe 3GPP authentication infrastructure employed in GBA includes Home\nNetwork (HN) functions User Equipment (UE) functions and the 3GPP AKA\n(Authentication and Key Agreement) protocol. This infrastructure is a\nvery valuable asset of 3GPP operators and could be leveraged to enable\napplication functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side\n\nInformation 2:\nused when authenticating the UE due to the nature of GBA.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<!\\-- new type definitions for different GBA procedures \\--\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"LegacyGBA\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nLegacy GBA where existing old authentication  \nframeworks are used for bootstrapping such  \n2G GBA in 3GPP, and CDMA 1x and CDMA 1xEvDo  \nin 3GPP2.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAMobileMobile\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA using AKA as specified in 3GPP and 3GPP2.  \nThe shared secret is derived in the mobile and  \nused in the mobile.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAUICCMobile\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA\\_U using AKA as specified in 3GPP and 3GPP2.  \nThe shared secret is derived in the UICC and used  \nin the mobile.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAUICCUICC\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA\\_U using AKA as specified in 3GPP and 3GPP2.  \nThe shared secret is derived in the UICC and used  \nin the UICC.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:element name=\\\"GBAMechanism\\\" type=\\\"GBAMechanismType\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:annotation\\>  \n\\<xs:documentation\\>  \nGBA mechanism used in the bootstrapping procedure.  \n\\</xs:documentation\\>  \n\\</xs:annotation\\>  \n\\</xs:element\\>  \n\\<xs:complexType name=\\\"GBAMechanismType\\\"\\>  \n\\<xs:choice\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"LegacyGBA\\\"/\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"GBAMobileMobile\\\"/\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"GBAUICCMobile\\\"/\\>  \n\\<xs:element ref=\\\"GBAUICCUICC\\\"/\\>  \n\\</xs:choice\\>  \n\\</xs:complexType\\>  \n\\</xs:schema\\>  \nE.4 GBA authentication context classes\n======================================  \nE.4.1 GBAOneFactorUnregistered\n------------------------------  \nThis class reflects that there were no mobile customer registration\n\nInformation 3:\napplication functions in the network and on the User Equipment (UE) side\nto establish shared cryptographic material based on 3GPP credentials.\nThis is the motivation and purpose of the Generic Bootstrapping\nArchitecture (GBA) and GBA Push features developed in 3GPP since Rel-6.  \nThe GBA architecture in releases prior to Rel-17 includes a\nBootstrapping Server Function (BSF) which is the anchor of the\ncryptographic key hierarchy, the Home Subscriber System (HSS), which\nhandles the user subscriptions and provides authentication vectors to\nthe BSF, UE applications and Network Application Functions (NAFs). GBA\nincludes a bootstrapping protocol for authentication and key agreement\nfor a root security key between the UE and BSF and a framework of\napplication session protocols (Ua protocols) to establish an application\nsecurity key between a UE and a NAF. The application security key is\nderived from the bootstrapping key. The GBA Push feature includes a\nprotocol between the NAF and the UE in order to establish the\napplication security key with a more efficient message exchange suitable\nfor constrained devices. GBA is specified to support at least the\nfollowing Diameter-based reference point interfaces: (a) Zh between the\nBSF and HSS for mutual authentication between the HN and the UE, (b) Zn\nbetween the BSF and NAF for the application security key establishment\nand (c) Zpn between the BSF and a GBA Push enabled NAF (Push-NAF) for a\ncombined mutual authentication and application security key\nestablishment. The use of these interfaces has allowed GBA to be used in\n3G and also in 4G core networks since the HSS in 3G and 4G supported\nDiameter-based interfaces.  \nWith the advent of 5G, the 5G Core (5GC) has introduced Network\nFunctions which expose SBA interfaces and among other network functions\na new subscription management network function, the User Data Management\n(UDM).

        "answer": "option 4: Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n860247       **Perf. part: UE power saving enhancements for NR**   NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh-Perf   R4   RP-212630       MediaTek  \nSummary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc., ZTE in RP-221544.  \nUser experience is key to 5G/NR success, not only in terms of\nexperienced data rates and latency but also importantly UE power\nconsumption. UE Power saving enhancements are therefore vital to the\nsuccess of 5G/NR. In Rel-17, additional enhancements are required to\naddress outstanding issues in Rel-16, including idle/inactive-mode power\nconsumption in NR SA deployments and connected-mode power consumption\nwith traffic of more frequent packet arrivals, etc. Accordingly, the\nfollowing new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:  \n\u2022 Enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging\nenhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive\nmode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in\nconnected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs  \n\u2022 Enhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH\nmonitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG)\nswitching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM\nand/or BFD in connected mode  \n**[Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in\nidle/inactive mode]{.underline}**  \nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the\ngroup of UEs monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple\nsubgroups. With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for\npaging if the subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via\nassociated paging early indication (PEI). Since the false paging\nprobability is reduced with subgrouping, UE reception power consumption\nin idle/inactive mode can be reduced accordingly. If the UE is unable to\nmonitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall\nmonitor the paging in its PO.  \nThese subgroups have the following characteristics:\n\nInformation 2:\nTRS in TRS occasions may allow UEs in RRC\\_IDLE/RRC\\_INACTIVE to sleep\nlonger before waking-up for its paging occasion. The TRS occasions\nconfiguration is provided in SIB17. The availability of TRS in the TRS\noccasions is indicated by L1 availability indication. These TRSs may\nalso be used by the UEs configured with eDRX.  \nUE power saving may be achieved by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD.\nWhen configured, UE determines whether it is in low mobility state\nand/or whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than a\nthreshold. The configuration for low mobility and good serving cell\nquality criterion is provided through dedicated RRC signalling.  \nRLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately through RRC\nConfiguration. Additionally, RLM relaxation may be enabled/disabled on\nper Cell Group basis while BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per\nserving cell basis.  \nThe UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation when relaxed\nmeasurement criterion for low mobility and/or for good serving cell\nquality is met. If configured to do so, the UE shall trigger reporting\nof its RLM and/or BFD relaxation status through UE assistance\ninformation if the UE changes its respective RLM and/or BFD relaxation\nstatus while meeting the UE minimum requirements specified in TS 38.133\n\\[13\\].  \nUE power saving may also be achieved through PDCCH monitoring adaptation\nmechanisms when configured by the network, including skipping of PDCCH\nmonitoring and Search space set group (SSSG) switching. In this case UE\ndoes not monitor PDCCH during the PDCCH skipping duration except for the\ncases as specified in TS 38.213 \\[38\\], or monitors PDCCH according to\nthe search space sets applied in SSSG.  \n12 QoS\n======  \n12.1 Overview\n-------------  \nThe **5G QoS model** is based on QoS Flows (see TS 23.501 \\[3\\]) and\nsupports both QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS\nFlows) and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate\n\nInformation 3:\n### C.3.2 UE efficiency analysis for NR positioning enhancements  \n#### C.3.2.1 Results from source \\[4\\]  \n##### C.3.2.1.1 Description of evaluation scenarios  \nThe UE efficiency is evaluated based on UE power consumption.

Before paging\nreceiving, the PSS/SSS monitoring is needed. Also RRM measurement(s),\nincluding intra- and inter-cell shall be performed.  \nThe DRX cycle for idle state / inactive state UE consists of an \\\"On\nDuration\\\" during which the UE should perform PSS/SSS monitoring, paging\nmonitoring and RRM measurement, and an \\\"Off Duration\\\" during which the\nUE can skip reception of downlink channels to save energy. It is\nillustrated in Figure 5.8.2.1.1-1.  \nTherefore the sleep ratio is determined by the length of \\\"On Duration\\\"\nand the length of one paging cycle.\n\nQuestion: What are the enhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving in NR?

The network indicates a timer smaller than the time the network\ngives up paging the UE.  \nNOTE: It could be possible for the operator or user settings to default\nto \\\"respond to paging\\\" if the UE is not busy in other USIMs.\n\nQuestion: How does a Multi-USIM UE indicate to the network that it does not accept the paging and requests to return to CM-IDLE state? [3GPP Release 17]\nOptions:\noption 1: By sending a specific AT command.\noption 2: By sending a Paging Restriction request to the network.\noption 3: By sending a UEAssistanceInformation message.\noption 4: By sending a Reject Paging response to the network.\noption 5: By sending a Service Request message.\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: By sending a Reject Paging response to the network.\n"

Both, 5G Media Streaming \\[13\\] and TV Video Profiles \\[3\\]\nbuild on CMAF-based Segment formats and DASH distribution. From 3GPP TS\n26.116, the following operation points may be considered in scope of the\n4K-TV Streaming Scenario (pending availability of appropriate test\ncontent):  \n\\- H.265/HEVC UHD, see 3GPP TS 26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.4.  \n\\- H.265/HEVC UHD HDR, see 3GPP TS 26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.6.  \n\\- H.265/HEVC UHD HDR HLG, see 3GPP TS 26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.8.  \nThis scenario is based on CMAF (including LL-DASH and HLS-LL)\ndistribution of UHD-TV video services over 5G networks to 5G/non-5G\ncapable devices. This includes 5G-equipped devices (e.g. smartphone,\ntablets,...) but also other devices gateway (e.g. TV sets,\nHDMI-Stick...) accessing services through a \"5G-gateway\" which can be a\nmobile phone or a home gateway. As multiple linear services will be\ndelivered in parallel (news, sport, talk show...) in a similar manner as\ntraditional TV services in a multiplex (potentially using\nmulticast/broadcast delivery over 5G). In certain environments, High\nFrame Rate (HFR) beyond 60 fps is considered, e.g. in DVB and ATSC\nbroadcast specifications. 3GPP does not have any HFR TV video profiles\nyet.  \nImportant aspects that are expected to be considered when evaluating a\ncodec in the context of this 4K-TV scenario are:  \n\\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:  \n\\- High and uninterrupted visual quality, considering the service\nconstraints.  \n\\- Any savings can provide significant benefits due to the expected\nlarge volume of the traffic either in quality or network utilization.  \n\\- Adaptive Bitrate streaming:  \n\\- Multiple bit rates are provided, typically with a ladder of 30--50%\nto permit bandwidth adaptation. The use of constant bit rate (CBR)\n\nInformation 3:\n### 6.3.1 Motivation  \nStreaming towards mobile devices is undoubtly the first natural use-case\nexpected for 5G-media streaming. However, consumption of video services\non fixed receivers (e.g. TV sets) remains a preferable way of\nexperiencing the high-quality content, whether it is for on-demand\n(e.g., blockbuster movies) or live services (e.g., sport events). Recent\nreports from largest VOD platforms such as Netflix confirm that\nassumption and show that the primary way of watching content remains\nfixed TV screens, covering 70% of devices 6 months after subscription\n\\[17\\]. In the same way, YouTube indicates that service usage on fixed\nTV set remains an inevitable way of accessing the content, with 250M of\nhours viewed per day on TV screens \\[18\\]. As 5G media streaming targets\na wide range of connected devices and is expected to be able to deliver\nvideo streams to many compatible high-resolution receivers, (e.g.\n5G-HDMI-sticks, 5G-StB/5G-MediaGateway or even 5G-TV sets) the inclusion\nof 4K TV Scenarios for 5G Video codec evaluation is important.  \nFirst, the 4K-TV set is currently the most established way of displaying\npremium quality services using latest technology improvements for video\ncontent, including High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) and Wide-Colour-Gamut (WCG).\nLatest statistics from the Ultra-HD forum indicate that 148 UHD services\nare currently on-air, 74% being linear, 45% of those using HDR \\[19\\].\nIn addition, a large number of SVOD operators propose 4K access in their\nsubscription packages (e.g. Netflix\u2122 and Amazon Prime\u2122). All these\nservices may eventually take advantage of 5G-network capabilities to\nincrease the device reach and enlarge audiences. This scenario is also\nendorsed by strong shipment forecasts, as indicated in the latest IHS\n4K-TV UHD bluebook \\[20\\].\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.2.2 Description of the Anticipated Application  \nIn the context of 3GPP services, 5G Media Streaming \\[13\\] as well as\nthe TV Video Profiles \\[3\\] are specifications addressing this streaming\nscenario. Both, 5G Media Streaming \\[13\\] and TV Video Profiles \\[3\\]\nbuilds on CMAF-based Segment formats and DASH distribution. From TS\n26.116, the following operation points may be considered in scope of the\nFull HD Streaming Scenario (pending availability of appropriate test\ncontent):  \n\\- H.265/HEVC Full HD HDR, see TS26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.3.  \n\\- H.264/AVC Full HD, see TS26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.4.3.  \n\\- H.265/HEVC Full HD, see TS26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.5.  \n\\- H.265/HEVC Full HD HDR HLG, see TS26.116 \\[3\\] clause 4.5.7.  \nThese operation points are further informed by relevant operational\nexperience with commercially available encoders and decoders.  \nThe considered scenario is the distribution of content through DASH/CMAF\nbased streaming. Important aspects that are expected to be considered\nwhen evaluating a codec in the context of this:  \n\\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:  \n\\- High and uninterrupted visual quality, taking into account the\nservice constraints.  \n\\- Any savings can provide significant benefits due to the expected\nlarge volume of the traffic either in quality or network utilization.  \n\\- Adaptive Bitrate streaming:  \n\\- Multiple bit rates are provided, typically with a ladder of 30--50%\nto permit bandwidth adaptation. The use of constant bit rate (CBR)\nencoding maximises reuse of a common ladder of encoded representations\nacross multiple distribution networks. The use of capped variable bit\nrate (VBR) encoding allows the bit rate to be varied according to the\ndifficulty of the source material while maintaining the ability to\ndistribute the encoded representations through distribution networks\nwith fixed capacity. This also maximises reuse of a common ladder across\nmultiple distribution networks.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.5.2 Description of the Anticipated Application  \nIn the context of 3GPP services, 5G Media Streaming \\[13\\] provides the\nfollowing encoding benchmark capabilities:  \n\\- HEVC-FullHD-Enc: the capability to encode a video signal with  \n\\- up to 133,693,440 luma samples per second, and  \n\\- up to a luma picture size of 2,228,224 samples, and  \n\\- up to 240 frames per second, and  \n\\- the Chroma format being 4:2:0, and  \n\\- the bit depth being either 8 or 10 bit,  \nto a bitstream that is decodable by a decoder that is HEVC-FullHD-Dec\ncapable as defined in clause 4.2.2.1 of TS26.511 and defined as the\ncapability to decode H.265 (HEVC) Main10 Profile, Main Tier, Level 4.1\n\\[3\\] bitstreams that have general\\_progressive\\_source\\_flag equal to\n1, general interlaced\\_source\\_flag equal to 0,\ngeneral\\_non\\_packed\\_constraint\\_flag equal to 1, and\ngeneral\\_frame\\_only\\_constraint\\_flag equal to 1.  \nBased on the considerations in clause 6.5.1, it is also recommended to\ntake into account the AVC-FullHD-Enc capabilities as defined in TS26.511\n\\[13\\]:  \n\\- AVC-FullHD-Enc: the capability to encode a video signal with  \n\\- up to 245,760 macroblocks per second, and  \n\\- up to a frame size of 8,192 macroblocks, and  \n\\- up to 240 frames per second, and  \n\\- the Chroma format being 4:2:0, and  \n\\- the bit depth being 8 bit,  \nto a bitstream that is decodable by a decoder that is AVC-HD-Dec capable\nas defined in clause 4.2.1.1 of TS26.511 and defined as the capability\nto decode H.264 (AVC) Progressive High Profile Level 4.0 \\[2\\]\nbitstreams.  \nBased on future expectations of higher quality uploads, it is also\nrecommended to take into account the HEVC-UHD-Enc capabilities as\ndefined in TS 26.511 \\[13\\]:  \n\\- HEVC-UHD-Enc: the capability to encode a video signal with  \n\\- up to 534,773,760 luma samples per second, and  \n\\- up to a luma picture size of 8,912,896 samples, and  \n\\- up to 480 frames per second, and  \n\\- the Chroma format being 4:2:0, and\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the extended work item on 8K Television over 5G?

The assistance information can be in\nthe format of a UE\\_ID that provides the best timing of the paging.  \n\\- UE\\_ID format for E-UTRA/NR is 10bits and for NB-IoT it is 12bits as\ndefined in TS36.304\\[2\\] and TS38.304\\[3\\].  \n\\- For perfectly overlapping POs (same serving RAN) then the UE\\_ID is\nequal to 5G-S-TMSI (of the other USIM) mod 1024.  \n\\- For non-overlapping POs than the UE\\_ID should not be equal to\n5G-S-TMSI (of other USIM) mod 1024.  \n\\- The network subsequently triggers the UE Configuration Update\nprocedure to assign a new 5G-GUTI.  \n\\- Additionally, if a collision is detected outside of any ongoing NAS\nprocedure, the UE initiates the Registration Update procedure indicating\nthat it would like to receive another 5G-GUTI and includes information,\nas mentioned above, to assist the AMF for assignment of the new 5G-GUTI.  \nThe same approach is used when the new 5G-GUTI is assigned via the UE\nConfiguration Update procedure.\n\nQuestion: How does a Multi-USIM UE modify the timing of paging occasions in 5GS?

The\nNetwork Slice requirement at the VAL server may be specified with the\nattributes of GST (which results in NEST) as specified in GSMA NG.116.  \n2\\. The VAL server requests the Network Slice allocation with the\nNetwork Slice requirements. The Network Slice allocation request\nincludes the VAL Service ID, VAL UE\\'s ID List, and S-NSSAI.  \n3\\. The NSCE server performs the Network Slice Allocation. If the NSCE\nserver act as NSaaS provider, and the existing allocated network slice\ncould satisfied the Network Slice requirements, the NSCE server\nallocates the existing network slice to the VAL. Otherwise, the NSCE\nserver as network slice provisioning MnS consumer requests of\n\\'AllocacatedNsi\\' operation as specified in 3GPP TS 28.531 \\[8\\].  \nWhen the \\'AllocatedNsi\\' operation is received, the network slice\nprovisioning MnS Producer performs charging mechanism as specified in\n3GPP TS 28.202 \\[28\\].  \nThe NSCE server performs AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to\n5GS per VAL UE.  \nNOTE 1: According to the network operator policy, the NSCE server acting\nas AF may send the created network slice information to the PCF via NEF\nas part of the AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5G system\n(as specified in TS 23.501 \\[16\\]). This guidance may create the new\nroute selection parameters to indicate sets of PDU Session information\n(DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be associated with applications matching the\napplication traffic.  \n4\\.

In case the appropriate\nNetwork Slice exists, the third-party request to use the Network Slice\nfor the service, and the corresponding entities modifies the info of the\nNetwork Slice properly. In case the appropriate Network Slice does not\nexist, then the third-party request to create the new Network slice.\nThis procedure should be handled with interaction between VAL server,\nNSCE and 5G network. Security aspects have to be considered. If there is\na need for resource reservation per customer, then dedicated slice is\nneeded.  \nAfter the Network Slice allocation is requested, UE should be notified\nthat the Network Slice for the third-party service is used.

Thus, informing the UE about\nDisaster Condition being applicable to a PLMN:  \n\\- via 3GPP access will enable **all UEs impacted by the Disaster\nCondition** to determine that Disaster Condition applies, subject to\navailabity of coverage of a PLMN in 3GPP access; and  \n\\- via non-3GPP access will enable **a subset of UEs impacted by the\nDisaster Condition** **only** (i.e. UEs supporting 3GPP access and\nnon-3GPP access only) to determine that Disaster Condition applies,\nsubject to availabity of non-3GPP access and availablity of a network\nsupport for non-3GPP access.  \nGiven that:  \n\\- the RAN sharing based approach requires that PLMN without Disaster\nCondition understands core network deployment of PLMN where the Disaster\nCondition might happen in future, and PLMN with Disaster Condition\nunderstands RAN deployment of PLMN without Disaster Condition; and  \n\\- the disaster roaming use case addresses PLMNs not normally\ncooperating (PLMN without Disaster Condition in the list of forbidden\nPLMNs of the UE of PLMN with Disaster Condition);  \nit is not reasonable to expect such deployment information sharing, and\nupdates of configuration of the network nodes, between the involved\nPLMNs, solely for disaster roaming functionality.  \n7.2 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue \\#2\n--------------------------------------------  \nAll solutions for KI\\#2 have no UE impact.  \nExcept Solution \\#8, all other solutions have RAN impact.  \nExcept Solution \\#7, all other solutions have CN impact.  \nSolution \\#6 relies on O&M operations which need not to be standardized,\n\nInformation 2:\ndeployment of PLMN where the Disaster Condition might happen in future,\nand PLMN with Disaster Condition needs to understand RAN deployment of\nPLMN without Disaster Condition, as:  \n1\\) to setup the N2 connection to appropriate AMF, NG-RAN node of PLMN\nwithout Disaster Condition needs to know AMF(s) of PLMN where the\nDisaster Condition might happen in future serving the area of the NG-RAN\nnode - see the clause6.9.1 stating \\\"*In order to be able to exchange\nan NGAP message when a disaster condition applies or no longer applies,\nif PLMN~NO\\ DC~ has an SLA to support disaster condition applied to\nPLMN~DC~ in an area, the NG Setup procedure is performed between all\nNG-RAN nodes of PLMN~NO\\ DC~ covering the area and AMF(s) of PLMN~DC~\ncovering the area in advance.*\\\"; and  \n2\\) to trigger appropriate RAN nodes to become shared RAN nodes, AMF of\nPLMN with Disaster Condition needs to know which area the RAN nodes of\nPLMN without Disaster Condition serve - see the clause6.9.1 stating\n\\\"*After being informed, the AMF of PLMN~DC~ notifies to NG-RAN nodes of\na PLMN without disaster condition (PLMN~NO\\ DC~) in the disaster\narea.*\\\";  \nc\\) works only when the UE is in coverage of a NG-RAN cell of a PLMN\nwithout Disaster Condition which can be shared by the PLMN with Disaster\nCondition.  \nSolution \\#3 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is\nout-of-coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition\ndoes not apply to the serving PLMN.  \nSolution\\#4 works only when the UE is in coverage of a NG-RAN cell of a\nPLMN without Disaster Condition.  \nSolution \\#4 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is\nout-of-coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition\ndoes not apply to the serving PLMN.  \nSolution\\#5 works only when the UE is in coverage of a NG-RAN cell of a\nPLMN without Disaster Condition which is willing to provide disaster\nroaming to UEs of PLMN with Disaster Condition.\n\nInformation 3:\nDisaster Condition performs notification of applicability of Disaster\nCondition and of disaster area to CBE and CBE notifies one or more PLMNs\nwhich can provide disaster roaming in the area, those PLMNs being\nselected by CBE, and that at least one of those PLMNs having at least\none NG-RAN node in the disaster area offering disaster roaming to the\nUEs in disaster area. The PWS SIB broadcast has to continue for the\nduration the PLMN is offering disaster roaming. This implies that all\nUEs (own subscribers and non-disaster roamers) are required to read the\nPWS SIB, which is an existing requirement.  \nCategory D: Dynamic sharing of RAN  \nSol\\#10: proposes the concept of dynamic shared RAN. In this solution,\nUE finds the PLMN it is interested in (HPLMN or VPLMN) as one of the\nshared PLMNs in another cell. This solution requires that all PLMNs have\na redundant N2 and N3 link with another NG-RAN node providing\noverlapping coverage in areas where disaster roaming service has to be\noffered. This implies the following:  \n\\- NG-RAN node of PLMN without Disaster Condition needs to know AMF(s),\nof PLMN where the Disaster Condition might happen in future, serving the\narea of the NG-RAN node to setup the N2 connection to appropriate AMF.  \n\\- AMF of PLMN with Disaster Condition needs to know which area the RAN\nnodes, of PLMN without Disaster Condition, serve to trigger appropriate\nRAN nodes to become shared RAN nodes Category E: Provisioning of\ninformation over non-3GPP AN at the time of disaster  \nParts of solution\\#11, solution\\#1 and solution\\#2 (Methods 1, 2 and 3)\naddress Key Issue\\#3 in a similar way.

In addition, scheduling flexibility and latency impacts have also\nbeen studied in clause 8.2.3.  \n\\- Three candidate schemes for PDCCH monitoring reduction have been\nidentified and studied with the corresponding coexistence and\nspecification impacts captured in clause 8.2.4 and clause 8.2.5,\nrespectively.  \nThe study of UE power saving on extended DRX in RRC\\_INACTIVE and/or\nRRC\\_IDLE can be summarized as follows:  \n\\- Extended DRX for RedCap UEs for RRC\\_IDLE and RRC\\_INACTIVE have been\nstudied. The study includes analysis of UE power saving, possible upper\nand lower bounds for eDRX cycles and study of possible mechanisms for\neDRX for RedCap UEs in clauses 8.3.1-8.3.4.  \n\\- The upper bound for DRX cycles and shorter eDRX values than 5.12\nseconds, i.e. 2.56 seconds have been studied and options are discussed\nin clause 8.3.3.  \n\\- Solutions for PTW and eDRX cycle configuration and which node should\nconfigure the eDRX cycle for RRC\\_INACTIVE have been studied and\nsolutions are captured in clause 8.3.4.  \nBased on the study of UE power saving on extended DRX, the following are\nrecommended from RAN2 perspective, where feasibility is to be confirmed\nwith SA2 and/or CT1:  \n\\- The applicable parts of eDRX mechanisms for LTE, including use of\n\nInformation 4:\n### 7.8.5 Analysis of specification impacts  \nFor specification impacts from each UE complexity reduction technique,\nrefer to clauses 7.2 through 7.7.  \n8 UE power saving features\n==========================  \n8.1 Introduction to UE power saving features\n--------------------------------------------  \nThe following UE power saving techniques have been studied:  \n\\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE\nlimits  \n\\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle  \n\\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices  \nThe outcomes of the studies of these techniques are captured in clauses\n8.2 through 8.4, respectively, and summarized in clause 13.  \nIn addition, RAN2 has studied the impact of introducing RedCap UEs on UE\npower consumption in general and has observed that power consumption of\nRedCap UEs may be impacted because of paging false alarm and unnecessary\nSIB1 reading. Paging false alarm and unnecessary SIB1 reading are not\nspecific to RedCap UEs and are discussed in Rel-17 Power Saving WI.\nEnhancements introduced by Rel-17 Power Saving WI should also be\napplicable to RedCap UEs.  \n8.2 Reduced PDCCH monitoring\n----------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\n### 7.10.2 Solution description  \n#### 7.10.2.1 General  \nThe following solution corresponds to the key issue \\#15 on supporting\nof constrained devices for Edge.  \nFor the constrained UEs, there are two aspects should be considered to\nreduce the power consumption, one is help UE turn into idle mode or DRX\nmode when there is no traffic transmitting between UE and network,\nanother one is help to reduce the traffic data rate when UE is connected\nto the network with transmitting packets.  \nEEC can get the knowledge about the constrained UE. When the\napplications are running with high power consumption, or the UE decides\nthat the battery level is low and should start power saving, the EEC\nshould send messages to EES with carrying such indication for low-power\nconsumption requirement and specific application identifier.  \nWhen EES gets low-power consumption indication from EEC, the EES should\ntrigger two methods to satisfy the constrained UE requirement.  \nMethod1: EES should send the message to corresponding EAS through EDGE-3\nthat the data rate should be reduced, so that the downlink data will be\nreduced and UE do not need to process high-bandwidth traffic. How to\nbalance the low-power consumption requirement and the UE experience is\nbased on the EAS implementation.  \nMethod2: EES should send the UE\\'s low-power consumption indication to\n3GPP core network. The 3GPP system may trigger some specific policies or\ntreatment for such applications and UEs e.g. changing the QoS profile AM\npolicies e.g. update UE-AMBR, UE- slice MBR, RFSP index and/or service\narea restriction, for those UEs as specified in TS 23.502 clause\n4.15.6.9, and changing the SM policies e.g. downgrade the QoS (e.g.\nreducing Requested Guaranteed Bitrate, Requested Maximum Bitrate) as\nspecified in TS 23.502 clause 4.15.6.6.  \nThis method may not satisfy the high-level experience of the application\nbut can support the application running basically.  \n#### 7.10.2.2 Procedure  \nPre-condition:\n\nQuestion: How can UE power saving be enabled by relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD?

A UE may also receive V2X messages via LTE-Uu unicast\ndownlink.  \nFor both operation modes, the following principles apply:  \n\\- V2X Application Servers e.g. in different domains can communicate\nwith each other for the exchange of V2X messages.

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 16.13.1 Introduction  \nA RedCap UE has reduced capabilities with the intention to have lower\ncomplexity with respect to non-RedCap UEs. It is mandatory for a RedCap\nUE to support 20 MHz maximum UE channel bandwidth in FR1 and 100 MHz in\nFR2.\n\nInformation 2:\nthat one RedCap UE type shall mandatorily support  \nIf early identification during initial access is supported, at least\nmaximum supported UE bandwidth during initial access (20 MHz for FR1 and\n100 MHz for FR2) is included in the set of L1 capabilities of the device\ntype for RedCap early identification. Note that this does not preclude\nthe case where the early indication only indicates whether it is a\nRedCap UE or which type of the RedCap UEs if multiple UE types are\ndefined.  \nAs a baseline, the existing UE capabilities framework is used to\nindicate the capabilities of RedCap UEs. As currently specified in\nRel-16, the UE reports its radio access capabilities at least when the\nnetwork requests the UE to do so.  \nThe network should be able to control whether RedCap UEs can access the\ncell and differentiate them from other, non-RedCap UEs. The number of\ndifferent UE types should be minimised to reduce market fragmentation,\nand UE types should be introduced only where essential to control UE\naccesses and differentiate them from other non-RedCap UEs.  \nThe UE capabilities can be categorized as:  \n\\- Minimum mandatory capabilities that all RedCap UEs support, if\nidentified.  \n\\- Optional capabilities, to be signalled explicitly.  \nFor capability signalling of RedCap UEs, the following scenarios are\npossible, however feasibility, applicability of the cases and the final\ndivision to categories depend on the exact RedCap capabilities (to be\ndefined):  \n\\- For the features that are mandatory for non-Redcap UEs:  \n\\- The Redcap UE mandatorily supports the feature with the same value.  \n\\- The Redcap UE mandatorily supports the feature, but with different\nvalue (e.g. bandwidth value).  \n\\- The Redcap UE optionally supports the feature.  \n\\- The Redcap UE does not support the feature at all.  \n\\- For the features that are optional for non-Redcap UEs:  \n\\- The Redcap UE does not support the feature at all.  \n\\- The Redcap UE supports the feature with a different value.\n\nInformation 3:\nsignalling.  \n\\- Option 2: Define a new IE specifically for RedCap UEs containing\nRedCap-specific capabilities. The IE is included in the signalling only\nby Redcap UEs.  \n\\- Option 3: The network identifies RedCap UEs based on identification\nsolution (see Clause 11.1), e.g. during Msg1, Msg3, MsgA, etc, (pending\nRAN1 conclusion). The identification is forwarded it to target gNB\nduring handover.  \n\\- Option 4: The network identifies RedCap UE based on the reported\ncapabilities, assuming the identification can be done through\nRedCap-specific capabilities not used by non-RedCap UEs.  \nFrom RAN2 perspective, the pros and cons to define only one device type\nor multiple device types are:  \nOnly one RedCap UE type:  \nPros:  \n\\- No market fragmentation of \\\"types\\\".  \n\\- Simpler specification, e.g. on early identification, access control,\netc.  \n\\- Avoid non-technical discussion outside 3GPP\\'s scope, e.g. product\nmanagement, similar to the discussions on LTE categories.  \nCons:  \n\\- Cannot provide independent access control for different UE types, if\nthis was deemed necessary.  \nMultiple RedCap UE types:  \nPros:  \n\\- Flexible access control is possible if necessary, e.g. independent\naccess control for different UE types.  \nCons:  \n\\- Potential market fragmentation of \\'types\\' leading to loss of\neconomies of scale and increased device costs.  \n\\- More specification complexity/effort, e.g. on early identification,\naccess control, etc.  \n\\- May lead to non-technical discussion outside 3GPP\\'s scope, e.g.\nproduct management, similar to the discussions on LTE categories.  \nThe need on independent access control for different RedCap UE types is\nnot discussed in the SI phase.  \n10.2 Constraining of reduced capabilities\n-----------------------------------------\n\nInformation 4:\n### 11.2.5 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs  \nThe purpose of the RedCap access restrictions is to eliminate or limit\nthe impact on legacy UEs. The impact for enabling any of above features\nis an increase is in OH due to added parameters in SI broadcast\nsignalling.  \nOne possibility is that separate RACH configuration is provided for\nRedCap UEs. In such case, it would be possible to configure different\nRACH parameters to RedCap and non-RedCap UEs, such as different maximum\nnumber for preamble transmission, different back-off timer after an\nattempt or a different power ramping step for RedCap UEs.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 10.2.1 Description of feature  \nThe study also includes an objective on how to ensure RedCap UEs are\nonly used for intended use cases, that is, UE identifying as RedCap UE\ncan only use services and resources intended for RedCap UE type. The\nfollowing potential solutions can be considered (the solutions do not\nneed to be mutually exclusive):  \n\\- **Option 1**: RRC Reject based approach  \nWhen the network knows the UE is a RedCap UE and the type of the service\nrequested, RAN can reject an RRC connection establishment attempt if the\nservice the UE requests is not allowed for RedCap UEs. The service type\ncan be known, e.g., based on the establishment cause provided in Msg3,\nthrough higher layer mechanisms or other ways.  \n\\- **Option 2**: Subscription validation (Note: SA2, CT1 confirmation is\nneeded)  \nDuring the RRC connection setup, the UE indicates that it is a RedCap UE\nto the core network, e.g.  \n\\- UE includes this indication in NAS signalling message to core\nnetwork; or  \n> \\- UE informs this indication during its RRC connection establishment\n> procedure to RAN; RAN then informs core network of the UE\\'s RedCap\n> type in the Initial UE Context message to core network.  \nThe network validates UE\\'s indication against its subscription plan,\nwhich includes information such as the set of services allowed for the\nUE. Network then decides whether to accept or reject UE\\'s registration\nrequest. For example, network may reject UE if UE indicates RedCap, but\nits subscription does not include any RedCap-specific services.  \n\\- **Option 3**: Verification of RedCap UE  \nNetwork performs capability match between UE\\'s reported radio\ncapabilities and the set of capability criteria associated with UE\\'s\nRedCap type.  \n\\- **Option 4**: Left up to network implementation to ensure RedCap UE\nuses intended services and/or resources.  \nThe decision on which option or options to choose will be made during a\npossible normative phase, and if needed, based on consultation with\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the RedCap UE type?

The AMF only\ntriggers paging over 3GPP access for the MT services allowed by the\nPaging Filtering Rules when the UE sent leaving indication to the\nnetwork. This information may be updated by a further Registration or\nService Request message when the UE needs not such filtering, or user\nsettings or preferences change. This filter is passed to the RAN for the\nUE in RRC inactive state, and the filtering is based on classification\nperformed at the UPF for user plane e.g. PPI value in the CN tunnel\nheader of the DL PDU. For example, the UE may want to receive paging\nrelated with voice service only, or data only, or disable SMS.  \nNOTE1: Standardized values are to be used for the identification of\nservices in the Paging Filtering Rules. So it should be PLMN\nindependent.  \nThe Paging Filtering Rules in the MUSIM assistance information in the\nRegistration Request may also block entirely the paging. If so, the\ninformation sent to the network is filtering all services as not\neligible for paging.  \nNOTE2: The Paging Filtering Rules can be based on user settings, e.g.\nthe user can make a configuration for which services are to be subject\nto paging per USIM. The user settings and preferences can also be\ntriggered when certain applications are started in a MUSIM device, to\nmake the behaviour dynamic and not just based on static configuration.  \nThe AMF provides the Paging Filtering Rules to the RAN so that the RAN\ncan decide whether to send paging to the UE of user plane services when\nthe UE is in RRC Inactive state (the paging for control plane services\n\nQuestion: What are the objectives of the schemes introduced in the MUSIM work item for LTE/NR?

The TM principles and TM architecture are\nspecified in 3GPPTS32.101\\[1\\] and 3GPPTS32.102\\[2\\].  \nNetwork Elements (NEs) under management, element managers as well as\nnetwork managers generate various management information stored in file\nformat. This IRP is addressing how these files are exchanged through\nItf-N as well as certain aspects of file management and maintenance. It\nis anticipated that management functions (e.g. PM, Call Trace, CM) make\nreuse of capabilities provided by this File Transfer IRP.  \n1 Scope\n=======  \nThe present document contains the Solution Sets for the IRP whose\nsemantics are specified in File Transfer IRP: Information Service (3GPP\nTS 32.342 \\[15\\]).  \nThis Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.342 V14.0.X\n\\[15\\].  \n2 References\n============  \nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in\nthis text, constitute provisions of the present document.  \n\\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\nedition number, version number, etc.) non\u2011specific.  \n\\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.  \n\\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

The combined\nperformance measurements and key performance indicators are also called\nperformance metrics.  \nManagement data is produced on request. Therefore, the 3GPP management\nsystem needs to enable a data consumer to request management data to be\nproduced. The data requester needs to specify the type of data to be\nproduced as well as the radio access network functions, core network\nfunctions and management functions where the data shall be produced. The\ntarget managed object instances can be identified in multiple ways:  \n\\- The requester can specify the target managed object instances based\non the managed object tree (as defined in the 3GPP Network Resource\nModels) representing the network and management functions. The simplest\napproach is to directly identify the managed object instances where data\nshall be produced. More sophisticated approaches allow to specify one or\nmore subtrees where data shall be produced and may allow also to specify\nmanaged object classes to select only object instances of specific\nclasses.  \n\\- The requester can specify one or multiple of the following selection\ncriteria. The system needs to translate this information into the target\nmanaged object instances. The selection criteria need to be\ndeterministic in such a way that the target node(s) can be selected\nunambiguously.  \n\\- Area of interest: In a big network, it makes sense to specify a\nlimited area for which data shall be produced. The area of interest can\nbe expressed for example with a geographical area, one or several cells\n\nInformation 5:\n### 4.1.1 Description  \nManagement data refers to data produced by radio access network\nfunctions, core network functions or management functions and used for\nmanagement purposes.

This implies that an ACCL will be assuring\ngoal(s) pertaining to the configured targets only. The SLS requirement\nmay come for a particular location. It would be beneficial if the ACL\ncan target a particular location while assuring the SLS. Strict SLS\nassurance for a service can be provided using ACL for a high-valued\nvertical customer present in a particular location. This will require\nconfiguring the ACL accordingly and would need ACL to collect the\nperformance measurements, while monitoring the network, for the same\ntarget location. The example of this may include SP assuring assurance\ngoal of guaranteed throughput for an eMBB service inside a customer\npremises.  \n6.2 Requirements\n----------------  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-01** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto take actions for a set of communication services serving certain\ngroup of UEs based on the target SLS.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-02** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto collect service experience information.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-03** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto analyse the performance information related to the set of\ncommunication services serving certain group of UEs.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-04** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto modify the configuration parameters related to the set of\ncommunication services serving certain group of UEs.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-05** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto collect NSI related data from one or more 5GC NF(s).  \nNOTE 1: An example for NSI related data may be QoE data.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-06** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto derive which communication service is associated to the QoE data from\nthe collected NSI related QoE data.\n\nInformation 2:\nto be assured for a domain the appropriate actions can be\nprovisioned.  \n-   it can ascertain the assurance goal status of a closed control loop\n> based on location and depending on which network characteristics\n> are to be assured the appropriate actions can be provisioned.  \nThe solution separates the goals that a closed control loop needs to\nfulfil from the results of the operation of a closed control loop. The\nresults (fulfilment status of a goal) for a closed control loop are\nprovided in a report including the observed fulfilment and predicted\nfulfilment. The goals for a closed control loop are derived from the\nservice requirements that are specified in a ServiceProfile or\nSliceProfile.  \nTo be able to deploy SLS assurance solutions the following objectives\nare addressed:  \n-   Add new service assurance management related use cases and\nrequirements according to deployment, assurance aspects.  \n-   Enhance the descriptions on closed loop and related interactions\nwhich are important for service assurance.  \n-   Describe new information in NRM which support the service assurance.  \nThis work item resulted in several CRs to update the communication\nservices assurance solution specified in TS 28.535 \\[1\\] and TS 28.536\n\\[2\\]  \n**References**  \nRelated CRs: set \\\"TSG Status = Approved\\\" in:\n<https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=870030>  \n\\[1\\] TS 28.535: Management and orchestration: Management Services for\nCommunication Service Assurance; Requirements  \n\\[2\\] TS 28.536: Management and orchestration: Management Services for\nCommunication Service Assurance; Stage 2 and stage 3  \n18.3 Enhancement of QoE Measurement Collection\n----------------------------------------------  \n-------- ----------------------------------------------- ------ ---- ----------- ----------------------------\n870027   **Enhancement of QoE Measurement Collection**   eQoE   S5   SP-200193   Petersen, Robert, Ericsson\n\nInformation 3:\n### 6.1.3 5G Core assisted SLS communication service Assurance  \nThe goal of this use case is to describe 5G Core management to assure\ncompliance to SLSs (Service Level Specifications) for a communication\nservice in 3GPP management system.  \n3GPP management system receives the SLS requirements that required by\nCSP or NOP. 3GPP management system is capable to translate e2e SLS goal\nand set the 5GC goal(s) of SLS related to 5GC and activate a closed\ncontrol loop for service assurance goal(s). To fulfill the SLS\nrequirements, 3GPP management system is capable to configure the\nmanagement resource and 5GC network functions (e.g. AMF, SMF, NWDAF) to\nmonitor measurements and fault alarms that are relevant to the SLS.\nSince, for example, a network slice for eMBB can provide multiple\ncommunications services, one or multiple closed control loops for\nservice assurance goals are set, and the network resource and\nperformance measurements which are relevant to the SLS.  \nDuring the process of service assurance of 5GC, the 5GC domain MDAS\nprovider can be used to provide analysis of 5GC related network\nresource, virtual resources and performance assurance related to SLS in\n5GC. The 5GC domain analysis report may be provided to 3GPP management\nsystem as part of the analysis result(s) of 5GC SLS.  \nTogether with the report from NWDAF, performance measurements and fault\nalarms related to 5GC NFs are also available for analysis of any\npotential service degradation.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.1.1 Communication service quality assurance and optimization  \n*The goal of the use case is to enable communication service* quality\nassurance and *optimization for the* set of services provided by the\nnetwork to certain group (category) of UEs. For example, the set can\ninclude the communication services provided via certain NSI(s) or to IoT\ndevices in certain area.  \nThe group of NG-RAN and 5GC nodes (deployed and active), which are\nessential for the set of E2E services, provide provisioning and PM\nmanagement services. It is also assumed that the providers of the\nrelated NSI / NSSI provisioning and PM management services are deployed\nand active.  \nThe management system is consuming the afore mentioned management\nservices either directly or through proxy nodes that re-expose the\nmanagement services; the management system is aware of the performance\nrequirements imposed on the set of communication services.  \nThe management system is collecting the service experience information\nand monitoring the KPIs, related to the targeted services. Analytics\nhosted by the MDAF may be utilized for processing of the network data to\nderive and analyse the KPIs. If the service quality assurance and\noptimization function detects performance degradation the 3GPP\nmanagement system may continuously modify the configuration parameters\nin the corresponding NG-RAN and 5GC nodes and NSI(s)/NSSI(s), to satisfy\nthe SLA requirement. In case that changes of communication service SLS\nare needed, those changes may result as input to the 3GPP management\nsystem.  \nIf the network performance does not recover or improve, the management\nsystem may further adjust the network configuration, or roll back to the\nprevious configuration. At all times the management system continues to\ncollect the network data and to monitor the performance indicators.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 5.1.4 Use case for interaction with core network for service assurance  \n*The goal is to* enable the 3GPP management system to take early action\nto prevent service degradation.  \nThe 3GPP management system configures the control plane functions (e.g.\nNWDAF) so as to report potential service degradation according to the\nSLS. Service load can be determined by considering both NF(s) load in\n5GC and network utilization in access network. If the service\ndegradation occurs or is predicted when the network capacity is\ndecreased, network capacity could be increased to solve the issue.\nTherefore, it is necessary for the 3GPP management system to configure\nthe 5GC functions such that in the event of a potential service\ndegradation or prediction of overloading, a notification is sent to the\n3GPP management system. This can be done by configuring the overloading\nconditions (e.g. triggering parameters) in the 5GC functions for a\nselected service. The 3GPP management system could configure the 5GC\nfunctions to trigger when the service load is increased or predicted to\nbe increased beyond a certain threshold level. The 3GPP management\nsystem could then increase the network capacity or use an MDAS to find a\nproper solution.  \nSimilarly, when the network resources are underutilized the 3GPP\nmanagement system could decrease the network capacity.  \n**REQ-CSA\\_RR-CON-01** The 3GPP management system shall be able to\nconfigure the 5GC functions to enable reporting of a potential service\nload increase beyond a certain threshold so that the 3GPP management\nsystem can increase the network resource capacity in time without\nimpacting the SLS.  \n**REQ-CSA\\_RR-CON-02** The 3GPP management system shall be able to\ndetermine the service load thresholds that need to be used by the 5GC\nfunctions to report, so that a potential network resource\noverprovisioning situation can be ascertained.  \n**REQ-CSA\\_RR-CON-03** The 3GPP management system shall be able to\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of Enhanced Closed loop SLS Assurance solution?

In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages\n(referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP\naccess, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may\nprovide an \\\"autonomous load-balance indicator\\\" in which case the UE\nand the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages\nfor each access type. The selected percentages may change over time,\ne.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select\nthe percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This\nmeans that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \\\"autonomous\nload-balance indicator\\\" can maximize the throughput of a given data\nflow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.  \n\\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication**: When the\nnetwork indicates that a data flow should be steered with the\nload-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a\n\\\"UE-assistance indication\\\" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide\nhow to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the\nUE\\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's battery level), and that (b)\nthe UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of\nthe matching data flow.  \nTypically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows\nfor which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example,\nwhen the network has no strong steering requirements for the default\ntraffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this\ntraffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% -\n50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other\nsplit percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to\n\nInformation 2:\navailable.

If the\nUE-assistance is set in the Steering Mode Indicator, the UE may inform\nthe UPF on how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of the matching\nSDF.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.12.2 High-level Description  \nWe refer to the steering mode operation described here as UE assisted\noperation. When this steering mode operation is applied, the UE decides\nhow traffic is steered, switched and split between 3GPP and non-3GPP\naccess based on UE state and UE knowledge of access conditions. The\nsolution works as follows.  \n1\\. The UE is configured with ATSSS rules including the UE assisted\ntraffic steering mode defined in Release 16 by the network. In addition,\nthe ATSSS rule indicates whether the \\\"UE assisted operation\\\" is\nallowed. Similarly, the UPF is configured with N4 rules, indicating\nwhether the UE is allowed to use UE assisted operation. The network\nindicates if splitting / load balancing is allowed.  \n2\\. The UE monitors UE state and access conditions of both 3GPP and\nnon-3GPP accesses (e.g. power consumption profile). Based on UE\nmonitoring, the UE may decide to activate the \\\"UE assisted\noperation\\\". If traffic splitting / load balancing is allowed, the UE\nmay determine the desired ratio of traffic split for uplink and downlink\ndirections. If traffic splitting is not allowed, the UE decides which\naccess to use for steering and switching for uplink and preferred access\nfor downlink.  \n3\\. In the uplink, the UE distributes traffic based on the desired\ntraffic split ratio or preferred access for uplink. The UE informs the\nUPF of the desired traffic ratio or preferred access for the downlink\nvia the PMF protocol. It is up to the UPF to take into consideration the\ninformation provided by the UE for downlink scheduling purposes.  \nEditor\\'s note: What information the UE provides to UPF in order to\nallow the UPF to identify the traffic and related PDRs, MARs etc is FFS  \nThe new steering mode operation only applies to non-GBR traffic.  \nNOTE: As specified in rel-16, a GBR flow is sent over a single access,\ni.e. the access to which the QoS profile has been provided.  \nThe UE assisted operation works will all Release 16 steering modes, and\n\nInformation 5:\nLoad-Balancing is only applicable to Non-GBR SDF. In addition, if one\naccess becomes unavailable, all SDF traffic is switched to the other\navailable access, as if the percentage of the SDF traffic transported\nvia the available access was 100%.  \n\\- Priority-based: It is used to steer all the traffic of an SDF to the\nhigh priority access, until this access is determined to be congested.\nIn this case, the traffic of the SDF is sent also to the low priority\naccess, i.e. the SDF traffic is split over the two accesses. In\naddition, when the high priority access becomes unavailable, all SDF\ntraffic is switched to the low priority access. How UE and UPF determine\nwhen a congestion occurs on an access is implementation dependent. It\ncan only be used for the Non-GBR SDF.  \n\\- A Steering Mode Indicator, which indicates that the UE may change the\ndefault steering parameters provided in the Steering Mode component and\nmay adjust the traffic steering based on its own decisions. Only one of\nthe following Steering Mode Indicators may be provided:  \n\\- Autonomous load-balance indicator: This indicator may be provided\nonly when the Steering Mode is Load-Balancing. When provided, the UE may\nignore the percentages in the Steering Mode component (i.e. the default\npercentages provided by the network) and may autonomously determine its\nown percentages for traffic splitting, in a way that maximizes the\naggregated bandwidth in the uplink direction. The UE is expected to\ndetermine its own percentages for traffic splitting by performing\nmeasurements across the two accesses. The UPF may apply a similar\nbehaviour when the autonomous load-balance indicator is included in an\nN4 rule.  \n\\- UE-assistance indicator: This indicator may be provided only when the\nSteering Mode is Load-Balancing.

The interim conclusion in TR 23.761 \\[2\\] is to have only one\n\\'paging cause\\' value for the voice service. However, UE needs to\ndiscriminate the case where the absence of Paging Cause in the Uu Paging\nmessage is due to a non-voice MT service from the case where the absence\nof Paging Cause in the Uu Paging message is due to a legacy RAN node\n(i.e., regardless whether the MT service is voice or not).\n\nInformation 5:\nstate when leaving RRC\\_CONNECTED for MUSIM purpose. gNB may release the\nUE to RRC IDLE/INACTIVE when receiving this UAI. The UE is allowed to\nenter RRC\\_IDLE if it does not receive response message from network\nwithin a certain configured time.  \nWhen determining it needs the MUSIM gaps, the UE sends the\nUEAssistanceInformation message, which indicates the UE's preference on\nthe MUSIM gaps. The UE can request at most a single aperiodic MUSIM gap\nand two periodic MUSIM gaps. The MUSIM gap is per UE level.  \n\\- Paging cause objective: a paging cause field with only one codepoint\nvoice was introduced in the NR/LTE Uu paging message, S1AP/NGAP paging\nmessage, and XNAP/F1AP paging message. The network provides this field\nfor the upcoming paging triggered by IMS voice, only if the UE indicates\nthe paging cause feature is supported to the network. In order to enable\nNG-RAN to deliver the paging cause in RAN paging for the UE in\nRRC-INACTIVE, the AMF provides an indication indicating the Paging Cause\nIndication for Voice Service feature is supported to the NG-RAN. The\nNG-RAN node knows the downlink data which triggers the RAN Paging\nmessage is related to voice service based on the Paging Policy\nIndicator, in the header of the received downlink data.  \n**References**  \nRelated CRs: set \\\"TSG Status = Approved\\\" in:\n<https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=860063,860163>  \n\\[1\\] RP-220603, Status report for WI  \n10 Energy efficiency, power saving\n==================================  \n10.1 UE power saving enhancements for NR\n----------------------------------------  \n**860047**   **UE power saving enhancements for NR**               **NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh**         **RP-212630**   **MediaTek**\n------------ ----------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ---- --------------- --------------\n860147       **Core part: UE power saving enhancements for NR**    NR\\_UE\\_pow\\_sav\\_enh-Core   R2   RP-212630       MediaTek\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Network notification objective introduced by MUSIM for LTE/NR?

This implies that an ACCL will be assuring\ngoal(s) pertaining to the configured targets only. The SLS requirement\nmay come for a particular location. It would be beneficial if the ACL\ncan target a particular location while assuring the SLS. Strict SLS\nassurance for a service can be provided using ACL for a high-valued\nvertical customer present in a particular location. This will require\nconfiguring the ACL accordingly and would need ACL to collect the\nperformance measurements, while monitoring the network, for the same\ntarget location. The example of this may include SP assuring assurance\ngoal of guaranteed throughput for an eMBB service inside a customer\npremises.  \n6.2 Requirements\n----------------  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-01** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto take actions for a set of communication services serving certain\ngroup of UEs based on the target SLS.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-02** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto collect service experience information.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-03** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto analyse the performance information related to the set of\ncommunication services serving certain group of UEs.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-04** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto modify the configuration parameters related to the set of\ncommunication services serving certain group of UEs.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-05** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto collect NSI related data from one or more 5GC NF(s).  \nNOTE 1: An example for NSI related data may be QoE data.  \n**REQ-CSA-CON-06** The 3GPP management system shall have the capability\nto derive which communication service is associated to the QoE data from\nthe collected NSI related QoE data.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 4.1.3 Procedures  \n#### 4.1.3.1 SLS Assurance Procedure  \nFigure 4.1.3.1.1 SLS assurance procedure  \nFor the purpose of the procedure shown in Figure 4.1.3.1.1 \\\"entities\nparticipating in the loop\\\" refers to any entity in the 3GPP management\nsystem responsible for the functioning of an ACCL to ensure the\nAssuranceControlLoopGoal required by an AssuranceControlLoop\\_Consumer.  \n1\\. AssuranceControlLoop\\_consumer derives AssuranceControlLoopGoal from\nthe ServiceProfile or SliceProfile.  \n2\\. AssuranceControlLoop\\_consumer provides the AssuranceControlLoopGoal\nto Entities\\_Participating\\_in\\_loop by utilizing the provision\nmanagement services defined in as defined in clause 11.1.1.3 of TS\n28.532 \\[7\\].  \nNOTE 1: In case the Entities\\_Participating\\_in\\_loop represents\nCrossDomain\\_Entities\\_Participating\\_in\\_loop, the\nAssuranceControlLoopGoal is the attribute(s) of the ServiceProfile.

It is assumed that the MnS\nproducer maintains SLS assurance closed control loops for multiple SLSs.\nThe detailed SLSs for network slice assurance are captured in\nServiceProfile (e.g. latency, Throughput) associated to network slice\nand the detailed SLS for network slice subnet assurance are captured in\nSliceProfile (e.g. latency, Throughput) associated to network slice\nsubnet.  \nWhen an MnS producer receives an SLS assurance closed control loops(s)\ncreation request with SLS assurance requirements for certain managed\nEntity (i.e. network slice, network slice subnet) from an MnS consumer,\nthe SLS assurance requirements may include information of which SLS\nshould be assured (e.g. latency should be assured), the SLS assurance\ngranularity (e.g. per UE, per Network Slice, per S-NSSAI), SLS assurance\ncondition (e.g. SLS assurance duration time, SLS assurance fulfilment\nrequirements (e.g. the ratio of the SLS assurance time during the whole\nservice usage time) ), the MnS producer create SLS closed control loop\nmanaged object instance contained by the specified managed Entity (i.e.\nNetworkSlice, NetworkSliceSubnet) and configures the received SLS\nassurance requirements in the created SLS closed control loop managed\nobject instances. The MnS producer performs the network and/or service\nmanagement to satisfy the SLS assurance requirements by adjusting the\nnetwork (e.g. adjust the network topology, configure RRM policy) to\nsatisfy the required SLS assurance requirements.  \nDuring the SLS assurance closed control loop operation phase, the MnS\nconsumer may request MnS producer to enable/disable the corresponding\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.1.8 Assurance closed loop execution supervision  \nAssurance closed loops have a defined goal related to a communication\nservice SLS may execute various actions in the deployed operator\nnetwork. To fully understand and trust the execution of such an\nassurance closed loop in the system, The MnS consumer of the assurance\nclosed loop may want to supervise the execution of the assurance closed\nloop at \"pause point\" during the Execute step of the closed loop. At\nthis pause point the consumer is enabled to review the available\ninformation. MnS consumer can set the pause point before the closed loop\nis running or when the closed loop is de-activated.  \nThe 3GPP management system provides the ability to enable or disable\nsuch \\\"pause point\\\" during the Execute step of the assurance closed\nloop. At a pause point, when notification is sent to the MnS consumer,\nthe consumer of the control loop can enable pausing the execution of the\ncontrol.  \nThe assurance closed loop pause point can be defined by the assurance\nclosed loop and set for \\\"Execute\\\" step only.  \nThe MnS consumer obtain the pause point capabilities for assurance\nclosed loop(s) from the MnS producer. For example, for NR coverage\noptimization closed loop, the pause point can be coverage adjustment\naction execution.  \nBased on the pause capabilities, MnS consumer requests the MnS producer\nto enable pause point for an assurance closed loop.  \nWhen a pause point is reached, the flow of the assurance closed loop is\npaused and the authorized MnS consumer is informed with the pause\ninformation. When the notified MnS consumer sends a resume request, the\nassurance closed loop flow will continue to execute to the next step of\nthe assurance closed loop. For example, when a pause point at coverage\nadjustment execute step is enabled, the MnS producer will not execute\ncoverage adjustment action and instead inform the authorized MnS\nconsumer that coverage adjustment action is determined and wait for\napproval.\n\nQuestion: What does the Closed loop SLS Assurance solution in TS 28.535 and TS 28.536 provide?

Note that\nthe UE executes these steps before connecting to a trusted non-3GPP\naccess network. This is different from the untrusted non-3GPP access\n(see clause6.3.6, \\\"N3IWF selection\\\"), where the UE first connects to\na non-3GPP access network, it obtains IP configuration and then proceeds\nto PLMN selection and ePDG/N3IWF selection. In the case of trusted\nnon-3GPP access, the UE uses 3GPP-based authentication for connecting to\na non-3GPP access, so it must first select a PLMN and then attempt to\nconnect to a non-3GPP access.  \nStep 1: The UE constructs a list of available PLMNs, with which trusted\nconnectivity is supported. This list contains the PLMNs included in the\nPLMN List-2 and PLMN List-3, advertised by all discovered non-3GPP\naccess networks.

The\nparticular PLMN or SNPN to be contacted may be selected either\nautomatically or manually.  \nThe MS looks for a suitable cell of the chosen PLMN or SNPN and chooses\nthat cell to provide available services, and tunes to its control\nchannel. This choosing is known as \\\"camping on the cell\\\". The MS will\nthen register its presence in the registration area of the chosen cell\nif necessary, by means of a location registration (LR), GPRS attach,\nIMSI attach or registration procedure.  \nIf the MS loses coverage of a cell, or find a more suitable cell, it\nreselects onto the most suitable cell of the selected PLMN or SNPN and\ncamps on that cell. If the new cell is in a different registration area,\nan LR request is performed.  \nIf the MS loses coverage of a PLMN or SNPN, either a new PLMN or SNPN is\nselected automatically, or an indication of which PLMNs or SNPNs are\navailable is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made.  \nRegistration is not performed by MSs only capable of services that need\nno registration.  \nThe purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:  \na\\) It enables the MS to receive system information from the PLMN or\nSNPN.  \nb\\) If the MS wishes to initiate a call, it can do this by initially\naccessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is\ncamped.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 9.5.1 Inter 3GPP access system mobility in Idle state  \nRefer to clause 7.5 in \\[3\\].\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.2.1 Packet idle mode  \nPacket idle mode is not applicable to an MS supporting DTM that has an\nongoing RR connection. An MS that supports DTM, that has an ongoing RR\nconnection and that has no assigned packet resource is in dedicated\nmode.  \nIn packet idle mode no Temporary Block Flow (see subclause 6.6.4.2)\nexists. Upper layers can require the transfer of LLC PDUs which,\nimplicitly, may trigger the establishment of one or more TBFs and\ntransition to packet transfer mode.  \nIn packet idle mode, an MS capable of multiple TBF operation may request\nthe establishment of one or more uplink TBFs during a two-phase access.  \nIn packet idle mode, the MS listens to the PBCCH and to the paging\nsub-channel for the paging group the MS belongs to in idle mode. If\nPCCCH is not present in the cell, the mobile station listens to the BCCH\nand to the relevant paging sub-channels.  \nWhile operating in packet idle mode, a mobile station belonging to GPRS\nMS classA may simultaneously enter the different RR service modes\ndefined in 3GPP TS44.018\\[6\\]. A mobile station belonging to either of\nGPRS MS classB or C leaves both packet idle mode and packet transfer\nmodes before entering dedicated mode, group receive mode or group\ntransmit mode. A MS that has enabled EC operation or PEO belongs to GPRS\nMS class B or GPRS MS class C mode of operation (see TS 44.018 \\[6\\]).\n\nInformation 5:\n### 12.3.1 Introduction  \nWhilst in idle mode, a COMPACT capable MS shall implement cell selection\nand cell reselection procedures as described in 3GPP TS43.022. These\nprocedures make use of measurements and sub-procedures described in this\nclause.  \nThe procedures ensure that the MS is camped on a cell from which it can\nreliably decode downlink data and with which it has a high probability\nof communications on the uplink. Once the MS is camped on a cell, access\nto the network is allowed.  \nThe MS shall not use the discontinuous reception (DRX) mode of operation\n(i.e., powering itself down when it is not expecting paging messages\nfrom the network) while performing cell selection algorithms defined in\n3GPP TS43.022. However, use of powering down is permitted at all other\ntimes in idle mode.\n\nQuestion: What action is necessary to get access to services in Idle mode?

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 4.2.4 Assignment of core network operator and core network node  \nWhen a UE performs an initial access to a shared network, one of\navailable CN operators shall be selected to serve the UE. For\nnon-supporting UEs, the shared network selects an operator from the\navailable CN operators. For supporting UEs, the selection of core\nnetwork operator by the UE shall be respected by the network. Supporting\nUEs inform the BSC/RNC/eNodeB of the network identity of the chosen core\nnetwork operator.  \nIn a UTRAN GWCN configuration, the RNC relays the chosen network\nidentity to the shared core network node (in UTRAN MOCN, the RNC\nindicates that the UE is a \\\"supporting UE\\\" by relaying the chosen\nnetwork identity to the core network node). To permit GWCN operation, in\nE\u2011UTRAN, the eNodeB always relays the chosen network identity to the\nshared MME. In a GERAN GWCN configuration, the BSC relays the chosen\nnetwork identity to the core network node (in GERAN MOCN, the BSC\nindicates that the UE is a \\\"supporting UE\\\" by relaying the chosen\nnetwork identity to the core network node).  \nIn a MOCN configuration, the RAN routes the UE\\'s initial access to the\nshared network to one of the available CN nodes. Supporting UEs shall\ninform the RAN of the chosen core network operator so that the RAN can\nroute correctly. For non-supporting UEs the shared network selects an\noperator from the available CN operators. A redirection to another CN\noperator may be required for non-supporting UEs until an operator is\nfound that can serve the UE. Redirection is described in clause7.1.4.  \nAfter initial access to the shared network the UE does not change to\nanother available CN operator as long as the selected CN operator is\navailable to serve the UE\\'s location. Only the network selection\nprocedures specified in TS23.122\\[4\\] may cause a reselection of\nanother available CN operator. Also the network does not move the UE to\nanother available CN operator, e.g. by handover, as long as the selected\n\nInformation 2:\n### 7.1.2 Non-supporting UEs in a GWCN configuration  \nThis example shows network selection for a non-supporting UE in a shared\nUTRAN/GERAN network. The UE is not a subscriber of any of the sharing\noperators and is under operator coordination. The UE is not coming from\nE-UTRAN i.e. the UE is not registered in any old MME. The UE is not\nserved by the shared SGSN nor by the shared MSC. After the first\nregistration attempted the operator accepts the UE after CS/PS\ncoordination.  \nFigure 3: Network selection for a non-supporting UE in a shared\nUTRAN/GERAN network  \n1\\. The UE reads the broadcast system information in the shared RAN.  \n2\\. A non-supporting UE cannot decode the shared network information in\nthe broadcast system information. The common PLMN is the only candidate\nto be considered together with other PLMNs for network selection.  \n3\\. The UE performs network selection among available PLMNs.  \n4a. The UE sends an ATTACH REQUEST/ROUTEING AREA UPDATE/LOCATION AREA\nUPDATE message to the network. The RAN selects CN node based on NRI\n(valid or invalid) if present or by random selection. A *redirect\nattempt flag* is included in the signalling from RAN to Core Network.\nThe signalling from the RAN to the Core Network enables the Core Network\nto determine that the UE did not select a Core Network operator. The RAN\nstores the NRI received from the UE.  \n4b. A *Reroute Command* message is sent back to the RAN node with an\nindication that it is for coordination purposes. The *Reroute Command*\nmessage includes the LAU/RAU /ATTACH REJECT message and the original\nATTACH REQUEST/ROUTING AREA UPDATE/LOCATION AREA UPDATE message received\nfrom the UE. Included is also IMSI and old LAI (for the CS domain) or\nold RAI (for the PS domain), or an indication whether the UE is\nattaching.  \n4c. At ROUTEING AREA UPDATE/LOCATION AREA UPDATE the RAN node concludes\nthat the UE is roaming under operator coordination and sends a ROUTEING\n\nInformation 3:\noperators  \nThe UE behaviour in both of these configurations shall be the same. No\ninformation concerning the configuration of a shared network shall be\nindicated to the UE.  \nFor the Evolved Packet System, only the PS domain of the above figures\nis relevant. For E\u2011UTRAN access Figures1 and 2 both apply but with the\nMME replacing the SGSN, the eNodeB replacing the RNC, and the S1\nreference point replacing the Iu interface.  \nFor GERAN access, both GWCN and MOCN are applicable but with the BSC\nreplacing the RNC and the A/Gb-Interfaces replacing the Iu interface.  \n4.2 Core Network Operator and Network Selection\n-----------------------------------------------  \nNetwork sharing is an agreement between operators and shall be\ntransparent to the user. This implies that a supporting UE needs to be\nable to discriminate between core network operators available in a\nshared radio access network and that these operators can be handled in\nthe same way as operators in non-shared networks.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 7.1.3 Supporting UEs in a GWCN configuration  \nThis example shows network selection for a supporting UE in a shared\nE\u2011UTRAN/UTRAN/GERAN network.  \nFigure 4: Network selection for a supporting UE in a shared\nE-UTRAN/UTRAN/GERAN network  \n1\\. The UE reads the broadcast system information in the shared RAN.  \n2\\. A supporting UE decodes the shared network information and supplies\nthe available core network operator PLMN-ids as candidates to the PLMN\nselection procedure. Only PLMNs in the Multiple PLMN ID List are\ncandidates for network selection.  \n3\\. The UE performs network selection among available PLMNs.  \n4\\. The UE sends an ATTACH/ROUTEING AREA UPDATE/TRACKING AREA\nUPDATE/LOCATION AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the network indicating,\nto the RAN, the chosen core network operator. The RAN converts the core\nnetwork \\'indicator\\' into the actual selected PLMN identity and sends\nthis with the ATTACH/ROUTEING AREA UPDATE/TRACKING AREA UPDATE/LOCATION\nAREA UPDATE REQUEST to the core network.  \n5\\. The shared SGSN determines whether the UE is allowed to attach.  \n6\\. The shared SGSN sends the appropriate ACCEPT/REJECT message back to\nthe UE.\n\nInformation 5:\ncandidates for network selection.  \n3\\. The UE performs network selection among available PLMNs.  \n4\\. The UE sends an ATTACH REQUEST message to the network. It also\nindicates to the BSC the chosen core network operator (via Initial L3\nmessage for CS domain, via AS signalling for the PS domain). The BSC\nuses the routing information to determine which core network operator\nthe message should be routed to and the ATTACH REQUEST message is sent\nto the core network operator chosen by the UE together with the chosen\nPLMN-id.  \n5\\. The core network determines whether the UE is allowed to attach to\nthe network.  \n6\\. The core network node sends the appropriate ACCEPT/REJECT message\nback to the UE. In case of an ATTACH ACCEPT message, the core network\nassigns the UE an appropriate TMSI/P-TMSI so that this identity can be\nused for any further rerouting of messages by the BSC.\n\nQuestion: How does a non-supporting UE select a core network operator to serve it in a shared network?

When receiving an NGAP Paging message\nfor a WUS-capable UE that also includes the *Assistance Data for\nRecommended Cells IE* then a WUS-capable ng-eNB shall only broadcast the\nWUS on the cell that matches the last used cell ID.\n\nQuestion: When is Paging with Wake Up Signal (WUS) used? [3GPP Release 17]\nOptions:\noption 1: When the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state\noption 2: When the UE is in RRC_IDLE state\noption 3: When the UE detects a PTW\noption 4: When the UE supports DRX\noption 5: When the UE supports GWUS\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 2: When the UE is in RRC_idle state\n"

These networks are very different to\ncommercial IoT device, they are usually less rugged, most highly battery\nconstrained and lifespan of the battery typically a couple of days or\nweeks. User plane traffic typically stays with a constrained\nenvironment, around the body or in the home i.e., within the PIN.\nNotifications can be received on smartphones that events have occurred\nwithin the PIN. A typical wearable PIN is depicted in Figure 4.3.1-1.  \nFigure 4.3.1-1: Wearable PINs (from \\[3\\])  \nOne use case in clause 5.3 of \\[3\\] is called \\\"Media share within\nPINs\\\".

With the support of the PEGC registered to 5G network, the PIN\nElements have access to the 5G network services and may communicate with\nother PIN Elements within the PIN or with the DN via 5GC. A PEGC may\nsupport multiple PINs. For each PIN, a dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI shall be\nconfigured.  \nPIN and PIN elements are managed by specific PIN element with Management\nCapability (PEMC) with support of an AF, if AF deployed. A PIN includes\nat least one PEGC and at least one PEMC.

Such mobile base\nstation relay is assumed to be mounted on a moving vehicle and serve UEs\nthat can be located inside or outside the vehicle (or entering/leaving\nthe vehicle).  \nNOTE: The radio link used between a mobile base station relay and served\nUEs, as well as between mobile base station relay and donor RAN, is\nassumed to be NR-Uu; in that regard, it should be clear that a mobile\nbase station relay is different than a UE relay (which uses instead a\nPC5-based link to provide indirect connection to remote UEs).  \nFew main underlying assumptions are:  \n\\- requirements cover single-hop relay scenarios as baseline (multi-hop\nis not precluded);  \n\\- legacy UEs are supported;  \n\\- other stage-1 requirements (e.g. on wireless self-backhaul), as well\nas existing stage-2/3 functionalities and architecture options (e.g.\nIAB) do not assume or address full relay mobility (e.g. relays on board\nof moving vehicles), thus cannot cover the requirements below, which are\nintended to be specific to mobile base station relays;  \n> \\- the identified requirements do not intend to imply or exclude\n> specific network/relay architectures and topology solutions (e.g.\n> could be IAB based, or others);  \n\\- the MNO managing mobile base station relays, and the RAN/5GC they\nconnect to, can be a PLMN or an NPN operator.\n\nInformation 5:\nThe 5G system shall support 5G LAN-type service for authorized UEs using\nindirect network connection or direct network connection.  \nThe 5G network shall be able to provide a remote UE using 5G LAN-type\nservice with same level of service as if the remote UE would be using a\ndirect network connection (i.e. provide required QoS for the Ethernet\npackets transferred between remote UE and relay UE if they are using\n3GPP access).  \nThe 5G network shall be able to support service continuity for the\nprivate communication between a remote UE with other member UEs of the\nsame 5G LAN-VN, when the remote UE changes from one relay UE to another\nor when the UE changes between direct and indirect network connection.  \n#### 6.26.2.9 Service exposure  \nBased on MNO policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow\na trusted third-party to create/remove a 5G LAN-VN.  \nBased on MNO policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow\na trusted third-party to manage a 5G LAN-VN dedicated for the usage by\nthe trusted third-party, including the address allocation.  \nBased on MNO policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow\na trusted third-party to authorize/deauthorize UEs to access a specific\n5G LAN-VN managed by the trusted third-party.  \nBased on MNO policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow\na trusted third-party to add/remove an authorized UE to/from a specific\n5G LAN-VN managed by the trusted third-party.  \n6.27 Positioning services\n-------------------------\n\nQuestion: What does the 5G system need to provide for mobile base station relays using 5G connectivity provided by a different MNO?

Where there is a\nconflict between these descriptions, the normative text has precedence.  \nThe timing advance procedure is used to derive the correct value for\ntiming advance that the MS has to use for the uplink transmission of\nradio blocks. This procedure is not used in dual transfer mode, in which\ncase the timing advance procedures for dedicated mode are used.  \nThe timing advance procedure comprises two parts:  \n\\- initial timing advance estimation;  \n\\- continuous timing advance update.  \n#### 6.5.7.1 Initial timing advance estimation  \nThe initial timing advance estimation is based on the single access\nburst carrying the Packet Channel Request, or in case of EC operation\nwhen using blind physical layer transmissions, on the access bursts\ncarrying the Packet Channel Request.  \nThe Packet Uplink Assignment or Packet Downlink Assignment then carries\nthe estimated timing advance value to the MS.

If the UE can read one or\nseveral PLMN identities in the strongest cell, each found PLMN (see the\nPLMN reading in \\[4\\]) shall be reported to the NAS as a high quality\nPLMN (but without the RSCP value), provided that the following high\nquality criterion is fulfilled:  \n1\\. For an FDD cell, the measured primary CPICH RSCP value shall be\ngreater than or equal to -95 dBm.  \n2\\. For a TDD cell, the measured P-CCPCH RSCP shall be greater than or\nequal to -84 dBm.  \nFound PLMNs that do not satisfy the high quality criterion, but for\nwhich the UE has been able to read the PLMN identities are reported to\nthe NAS together with the CPICH RSCP value for UTRA FDD cells and\nP-CCPCH RSCP for UTRA TDD cells. The quality measure reported by the UE\nto NAS shall be the same for each PLMN found in one cell.  \nThe search for PLMNs on the rest of the carriers may be stopped on\nrequest of the NAS. The UE may optimise this search by using stored\ninformation of carrier frequencies and optionally also information on\ncell parameters, e.g. scrambling codes, from previously received\nmeasurement control information elements.  \nOnce the UE has selected a PLMN, the cell selection procedure shall be\nperformed in order to select a suitable cell of that PLMN to camp on.  \nIf a CSG ID is provided by NAS as part of PLMN selection, the UE shall\nsearch for an acceptable or suitable cell belonging to the provided CSG\nID to camp on. When the UE is no longer camped on a cell with the\nprovided CSG ID, AS shall inform NAS.  \n#### 5.1.2.3 GSM case\n\nInformation 5:\nReferences: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are\nspecified in: TS 36.304 clause 5.1.2.2, TS 23.122 clauses 4.4.3.1 and\n4.4.3.1.2.  \n\\[TS 36.304 clause 5.1.2.2\\]  \nThe UE shall scan all RF channels in the E-UTRA bands according to its\ncapabilities to find available PLMNs.

The reason\nfor such steering may be load balancing (for camped- and traffic load\nbalancing), operator policy, private networks/home cells, service based\nmobility control etc.  \nThe RPLMN shall be able to download on the UE a list of preferred access\ntechnologies in priority order. If, while the UE is registered on that\nPLMN, an access technology with higher priority than the one currently\nused is detected, the UE shall attempt to use the higher priority access\nnetwork to access the RPLMN.  \nThe UE shall only perform access technology selection within the RPLMN.  \nIn case the UE is connected to the PLMN via a non-3GPP access, then the\nPLMN reselection procedures specified for that access technology may be\nexecuted.  \nNote 1: The PLMN operator may provide access to the Evolved Packet Core\neither through an own access network (E-UTRA or non-3GPP access) or in\ncollaboration with an access network operator that operates a non-3GPP\naccess network.  \nNote 2: A specific non-3GPP RAT may e.g. be identified by RAT type and\nthe access network name (as advertized by the access network), or a list\nof access network names.  \nThe HPLMN may also provide the UE with a list of preferred access\ntechnologies in priority order for use in the RPLMN. Only one list of\npreferred access technologies can be active at a time and the list\nprovided by the RPLMN takes precedence over the list provided by the\nHPLMN. The list of preferred access technologies received from the VPLMN\nis specific to that VPLMN and PLMNs equivalent to it.\n\nQuestion: What is one of the requirements for interworking between fixed access and Evolved Packet Core? [3GPP Release 17]\nOptions:\noption 1: Efficient usage of system resources\noption 2: Policy management and authentication for WLAN terminals\noption 3: Routing different PDN connections through different accesses\noption 4: Support for simultaneous access to PLMN services\noption 5: Support for offline charging for traffic routed via the Evolved Packet Core\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: Support for simultaneous access to PLMN services\n"

Typically, there is at\nleast one connection per 10 m^2^, which results in a connection density\nof up to 10^5^ km^-2^.\n\nInformation 3:\nheight=\"0.8784722222222222in\"}  \nFigure D.1-3: MTBF and MTTR  \nNote that the time for an application to recover from a failure\n(recovery time) due to e.g. a robot arm having to be moved to a safe\nstart position, is totally dependent on the application, which the\ncommunication service can hardly influence. In general, the application\nwith a long recovery time may require very stringent communication\nservice reliability as any occurrence of communication failure greatly\nimpacts the application down-time and hence the overall production\nsystem availability. On the other hand, if the application recovers very\nfast, it can likely tolerate more frequent failures of the communication\nsystem, while achieving the same overall production system availability\ntarget. In such case the communication service reliability could be more\nrelaxed (compared to the above case).  \nD.2 Communication system parameters and influence quantities\n------------------------------------------------------------  \nWhile application availability is the KPI for industrial automation, the\napplication per se is outside the scope of 3GPP. 3GPP's scope includes\nproviding communications system which, with the appropriate deployment\noptions, can meet the performance indicators to support application's\ncommunications needs. A number of parameters and influence quantities\ncan be taken into account to maximize support for application\navailability, to the extent possible by the 3GPP system. From the\nillustrations above, these include communication service availability,\ncommunication service reliability, and survival time.  \n######### Annex E: Requirements mapping use case to merged  \nThe potential new requirements of the studied use cases in clause 5 have\nbeen consolidated into the merged potential service requirements in\nclause 6. Table E-1 provides this mapping from the potential new\nrequirements of the use cases to the corresponding merged and\n\nInformation 4:\n### D.2.2 Security  \nNetwork access and authorization in an industrial factory deployment is\ntypically provided and managed by the factory owner with its ID\nmanagement, authentication, confidentiality and integrity.  \nA comprehensive security framework for factories has been described in\nIEC 62443.  \nD.3 Process automation\n----------------------  \nProcess automation has much in common with discrete automation (see\nAnnex D.2). Instead of discrete products (cars, chocolate bars, etc.),\nprocess automation addresses the production of bulk products such as\npetrol and reactive gases. In contrast to discrete automation, motion\ncontrol is of limited or no importance. Typical end-to-end latencies are\n50 ms. User experienced data rates, communication service availability,\nand connection density vary noticeably between applications. Below we\ndescribe one emerging use case (remote control via mobile computational\nunits, see Annex D.3.1) and a contemporary use case (monitoring, see\nAnnex D.3.2).  \nNote that discrete automation fieldbuses (see Annex D.2) are also used\nin process automation.\n\nInformation 5:\n### D.2.0 General  \nFactory automation encompasses all types of production that result in\ndiscrete products: cars, chocolate bars, etc. Automation that addresses\nthe control of flows and chemical reactions is referred to as process\nautomation (see clause D.3). Discrete automation requires communications\nfor supervisory and open-loop control applications, as well as process\nmonitoring and tracking of operations inside an industrial plant. In\nthese applications, a large number of sensors, which are distributed\nover the plant, forward measurement data to process controllers on a\nperiodic or event-driven base. Traditionally, wireline field bus\ntechnologies have been used to interconnect sensors and control\nequipment. Due to the sizable extension of a plant (up to10km^2^), the\nlarge number of sensors, rotary joints, and the high deployment\ncomplexity of wired infrastructure, wireless solutions have made inroads\ninto industrial process automation.  \nThe related use cases require support of a large number of sensor\ndevices per plant, as well as high communication service availability\n(99,99%). Furthermore, power consumption is relevant since some sensor\ndevices are battery-powered with a targeted battery lifetime of several\nyears (while providing measurement updates every few seconds). Range\nalso becomes a critical factor due to the low transmit power levels of\nthe sensors, the large size of the plant, and the high-reliability\nrequirements on transport. End-to-end latency requirements typically\nrange between 10ms and 1s. User-experienced data rates can be rather\nlow since each transaction typically comprises less than 256 bytes.\nHowever, there has been a shift from field busses featuring somewhat\nmodest data rates (\\~ 2 Mbit/s) to those with higher data rates (\\~ 10\nMbit/s) due to the increasing number of distributed applications and\n\\\"data-hungry\\\" applications. An example for the latter is the visual\ncontrol of production processes. For this application, the user\n\nQuestion: What is the typical connection density in factory automation applications?

The routing information includes both Target (H)eNB ID and source\n(H)eNB ID. The X2 GW routes the message based on the target (H)eNB ID.\nThe source (H)eNB ID is used by the destination (H)eNB node to reply.  \n#### 4.6.6.3 (H)eNB unavailability  \nUpon the detection that the signalling (i.e. SCTP) connection to a\n(H)eNB is unavailable, the X2 GW initiates the X2 Release procedure to\ninform the relevant (H)eNBs. The relevant (H)eNBs are the ones which had\nan \\\"X2AP association\\\" with this (H)eNB via the X2 GW when the\nsignalling connection became unavailable.  \n#### 4.6.6.4 (H)eNB registration  \nRegistration of a (H)eNB is performed by initiating the X2AP Message\nTransfer procedure towards the X2 GW signalling a Source (H)eNB ID, no\nTarget (H)eNB ID, and no X2AP Message in the X2AP MESSAGE TRANSFER\nmessage.

Each HeNB is preconfigured\nwith information about which X2 GW it connects to, e.g. an IP address of\nthe X2 GW.  \n\\- There is no limitation on the number of X2 GWs an eNB may connect to.  \n\\- The X2 GW does not terminate X2AP procedures except for the X2AP\nMessage Transfer procedure, but it initiates the X2 Release procedure\nand the X2 Error Indication procedure.  \n\\- This version of the specification does not support an interface\nbetween two X2 GWs. The routing of X2AP messages via more than one X2 GW\n(i.e. more than two SCTP hops) is not allowed.  \n\\- X2AP contexts only exist in the two peer (H)eNBs (same as without X2\nGW).

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n**Moving from PS-CONNECTED to PS-IDLE:**  \nThe state transition from PS-CONNECTED to PS-IDLE is performed when the\nsignalling connection for PS services is released, e.g. at release of a\nPS service, no other PS service is ongoing and at release of the RRC\nconnection in case of very low level of activity. A radio link failure\ncan also trigger this state transition.  \n**Moving from PS-IDLE to PS-DETACHED:**  \nThe transition from PS-IDLE to PS-DETACHED can be triggered by some\naction from the user of the UE but an expiring timer in the network\ncould also trigger it. The UE is marked as PS\\_DETACHED in the CN and\nthen as a consequence no PS service establishment is possible.  \n6.7 The RRC state machine\n-------------------------  \nThe UTRAN RRC state machine is a description model of how the UE and the\nRAN co-operate regarding RRC functionality. The RRC state describes the\nstate of the UE in the RAN. Here follows a brief description of the\nUTRAN RRC state machine, for more information see TS25.301\\[6\\] and\nTS25.303\\[7\\]. The E-UTRAN RRC state machine is described in\nTS36.331\\[29\\].  \nNOTE: RRC idle mode and RRC connected mode refer to the UE idle mode and\nUE connected mode respectively in TS25.301\\[6\\] and TS25.303\\[7\\].  \nThe RRC state machine exists as peer entities, one in the UE and one in\nRAN. Apart from transient situations and error cases they are\nsynchronised. Figure 6.4 illustrates the main modes/states of the RRC\nstate machine.  \n![](media/image17.wmf)  \nFigure 6.4: RRC modes, main RRC states and main mode/state transitions  \n**RRC-Idle\\_mode:**  \nIn the Idle mode there is no connection established between UE and RAN.\nThere is no signalling between RAN and the UE except for system\ninformation that is sent from RAN down link on a Broadcast channel to\nthe UE. The UE can also receive paging messages with a CN identity on\nthe PCH. There is no information on the UE stored in RAN in this state.  \n**RRC-Connected\\_mode:**\n\nInformation 2:\n### 7.2.1 Overview  \nRRC-Inactive/CM-Connected was specified in Rel-15 as a new efficient\nstate for 5G UEs. The key benefits for RRC-Inactive/CM-Connected\ncompared to RRC-Idle/CM-Idle are the following:  \n\\- UE can resume the AS connection without performing e.g. AS security\nsetup, and save several RRC message interactions between the UE and RAN.  \n\\- There is no RAN and CN interaction when the UE change state\nRRC-Inactive to/from RRC-Connected, if not required.  \n\\- User plane reconfiguration is not needed.  \nThe area in which the UE move around in without the UE needs to perform\nUpdate due to mobility maybe much smaller than compared to RRC-Idle. In\nRRC-Inactive the area is defined by the Radio Notification Area (RNA)\nconsisting of a set of RAN nodes. In RRC-Idle then the area is the whole\nRegistered Area (RA) consisting of a set of Tracking Areas. This may\nresult in more frequent Updates due to mobility.\n\nInformation 3:\nRRC Inactive state applies to NG-RAN. UE support for RRC Inactive state\nis defined in TS38.306\\[69\\] for NR and TS36.306\\[70\\] for E-UTRA\nconnected to 5GC. RRC Inactive is not supported by NB-IoT connected to\n5GC.  \nThe AMF shall provide assistance information to the NG-RAN, to assist\nthe NG-RAN\\'s decision whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state\nexcept due to some exceptional cases such as:  \n\\- PLMN (or AMF set) does not support RRC Inactive;  \n\\- The UE needs to be kept in CM-CONNECTED State (e.g. for tracking).  \nThe \\\"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\\\" includes:  \n\\- UE specific DRX values;  \n\\- UE specific extended idle mode DRX values (cycle length and Paging\nTime Window length);  \n\\- The Registration Area provided to the UE;  \n\\- Periodic Registration Update timer;  \n\\- If the AMF has enabled MICO mode for the UE, an indication that the\nUE is in MICO mode;  \n\\- Information from the UE identifier, as defined in TS38.304\\[50\\]\nfor NR and TS36.304\\[52\\] for E-UTRA connected to 5GC, that allows the\nRAN to calculate the UE\\'s RAN paging occasions;  \n\\- An indication that Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service is\nsupported;  \n\\- AMF PEIPS Assistance Information (see clause5.4.12.2) for paging a\nUE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state over NR as defined in\nTS38.300\\[27\\].  \nThe RRC Inactive Assistance Information mentioned above is provided by\nthe AMF during N2 activation with the (new) serving NG-RAN node (i.e.\nduring Registration, Service Request, Handover) to assist the NG RAN\\'s\ndecision whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state. If the AMF\nallocates a new Registration Area to the UE, the AMF should update the\nNG-RAN with the new Registration Area by sending the RRC Inactive\nAssistance Information accordingly. The Paging Cause Indication for\nVoice Service is used to assist NG RAN to perform RAN based paging.  \nRRC Inactive state is part of RRC state machine, and it is up to the RAN\n\nInformation 4:\nRRC Inactive state is part of RRC state machine, and it is up to the RAN\nto determine the conditions to enter RRC Inactive state. If any of the\nparameters included in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information changes\nas the result of NAS procedure, the AMF shall update the RRC Inactive\nAssistance Information to the NG-RAN node.  \nWhen the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, if the AMF has provided RRC\nInactive assistance information, the RAN node may decide to move a UE to\nCM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state.  \nThe state and \\\"endpoints\\\" (in the case of Dual Connectivity\nconfiguration) of the N2 and N3 reference points are not changed by the\nUE entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state. A UE in RRC inactive\nstate is aware of the RAN Notification area and periodic RAN\nNotification Area Update timer.  \nThe 5GC network is not aware of the UE transitions between CM-CONNECTED\nwith RRC Connected and CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, unless the\n5GC network is notified via N2 notification procedure in clause4.8.3 of\nTS23.502\\[3\\].  \nAt transition into CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN\nconfigures the UE with a periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer\ntaking into account the value of the Periodic Registration Update timer\nvalue indicated in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information, and uses a\nguard timer with a value longer than the RAN Notification Area Update\ntimer value provided to the UE.  \nIf the periodic RAN Notification Area Update guard timer expires in\nNG-RAN, the NG-RAN shall initiate AN Release procedure as specified in\nclause4.2.6 of TS23.502\\[3\\].  \nWhen the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE performs\nPLMN selection procedures as defined in TS23.122\\[17\\] and\nTS24.501\\[47\\].  \nWhen the UE is CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE may resume\nthe RRC Connection due to:  \n\\- Uplink data pending;  \n\\- Mobile initiated NAS signalling procedure;  \n\\- As a response to RAN paging;\n\nInformation 5:\nindication of RRC Inactive with CM-IDLE. In this case the RAN performs\nregular CN paging.  \nFrom UE perspective, when the UE enters RRC-Inactive with CM-IDLE, the\nbehaviour is the same as for RRC-Inactive with CM-CONNECTED, i.e.:  \n\\- If the UE receives RAN paging, it attempts RRC resume procedure.  \n\\- If RRC resume fails the UE falls back to CM-IDLE with RRC Idle and\ninitiates RRC connection establishment request.  \n\\- If the UE receives CN paging, it moves to CM-IDLE with RRC Idle and\ninitiates RRC connection establishment request.  \n\\- If the UE steps outside RAN notification area, the UE initiates RAN\nNotification Area Update.  \n\\- The UE performs periodic RAN notification Area Update.  \n\\- The UE performs periodic registration update.\n\nQuestion: Which RRC state is the UE in when no RRC connection is established?

An abbreviation defined in\nthe present document takes precedence over the definition of the same\nabbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\].  \n\\<ACRONYM\\> \\<Explanation\\>  \n4 Overview\n==========  \nThe concept of network slice was discussed from the beginning of the\nstudy for 5G system. Network slicing supports the flexible use of\nnetwork resources so that multiple networks customized to the needs of\neach set of applications can be provided simultaneously over the network\nresources while ensuring resource isolation and meeting different SLAs.\nAs more diverse industries start to use the capabilities provided by 5G\nsystem and various new services are implemented over the 5G system, the\nexpected service requirements on the 5G system vary. To meet these\ndiverse requirements on the network, the use of network slices will\nincrease further as 5G system deployments are expanded.  \nWhen configuring network slices within its network, each network\noperator may consider various factors, such as required QoS of the\napplications supported over the network slices, the amount of required\nnetwork resources to support the applications, the expected geographical\nand time boundary where the network slice services need to be provided,\nthe usable and deployed network resources at the location where the\napplications are used, the number of users, the type of devices (e.g.,\nIIoT), etc. After considering these factors, a network operator may\nprovide a network slice for different services to users. Similarly, 3rd\nparties may be authorized by the network operator to configure their own\nnetwork slices based on these various criteria, within the bounds of an\nSLA with the network operator.  \nHowever, the provisioning of network slices can be complicated, such as\nwhen a UE requests the simultaneous use of multiple network slices where\n\nInformation 2:\n|                | on             |                |                |\n|                | prioritization |                |                |\n|                | of certain     |                |                |\n|                | slices against |                |                |\n|                | others:        |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n|                | The 5G system  |                |                |\n|                | shall enable   |                |                |\n|                | the network    |                |                |\n|                | operator to    |                |                |\n|                | define a       |                |                |\n|                | priority order |                |                |\n|                | between        |                |                |\n|                | different      |                |                |\n|                | network slices |                |                |\n|                | in case        |                |                |\n|                | multiple       |                |                |\n|                | network slices |                |                |\n|                | compete for    |                |                |\n|                | resources on   |                |                |\n|                | the same       |                |                |\n|                | network.       |                |                |\n+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n| 6.10.2,        | All            | T              | See 3GPP TS    |\n|                | requirements   |                | 22.261         |\n| 6.1.2.3        | related to     |                |                |\n|                | private slice  |                |                |\n|                | management,    |                |                |\n\nInformation 3:\n### 4.4.1 General  \nNetwork slicing in accordance with 3GPPTS23.501\\[7\\] can be used for\nseveral purposes such as to separate MC service users, UEs as well as\napplications in accordance with the various QoS requirements independent\nfrom 3GPP or non-3GPP access.  \nThe corresponding slice information identifies a network slice across\nthe 5G core, access network and the UE.
