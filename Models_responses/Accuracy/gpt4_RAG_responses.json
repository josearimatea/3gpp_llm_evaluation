        "response": "To determine what SL DRX stands for in the context of NR Sidelink, we can analyze the provided information, particularly focusing on Information 5, which explicitly mentions \"SL DRX\" and provides a definition.\n\n1. The section titled \"16.9.6 SL DRX\" indicates that SL DRX supports various types of communication: unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. \n2. It discusses parameters that determine the active time for SL DRX, which includes timers related to reception (on-duration, inactivity-timer, retransmission-timer, cycle).\n3. The text suggests that during SL DRX inactive time, the UE may skip monitoring of signals for data reception.\n4. The term \"Discontinuous Reception\" is commonly associated with DRX in wireless communication, where a device can alternate between active and inactive states to conserve power while still being able to receive data.\n\nGiven this context, the most logical interpretation of SL DRX is \"Sidelink Discontinuous Reception.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\ncorrect option: 4"

        "question": "How does a non-supporting UE select a core network operator to serve it in a shared network? [3GPP Release 17]",
        "answer": "option 2: The shared network selects an operator for the UE.",
        "response": "To determine how a non-supporting UE selects a core network operator in a shared network, let's analyze the provided information step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding Non-Supporting UEs**: According to Information 2, a non-supporting UE is not registered with any of the sharing operators and cannot decode the shared network information in the broadcast system. Thus, it cannot make an informed choice.\n\n2. **Network Selection Process**: The process outlined in Information 2 indicates that the non-supporting UE reads the broadcast system information and considers the common PLMN as the only candidate for network selection. After this, the UE performs network selection among available PLMNs.\n\n3. **Operator Selection**: When the non-supporting UE sends an ATTACH REQUEST message, the RAN (Radio Access Network) selects a core network node based on the NRI (Network Resource Identifier) if present, or by random selection. This shows that the selection is not made by the UE itself.\n\n4. **RAN's Role**: The RAN is responsible for routing the UE's initial access to the shared network and selecting the core network operator when the UE does not provide a choice. This indicates that the shared network makes the selection for the non-supporting UE.\n\nGiven these points, the correct option is that the shared network selects an operator for the UE.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\ncorrect option: 2"

This indicates that the UE is actively engaging with the PDCCH candidates defined for Type1.\n\n2. **Type2-PDCCH CSS Set**: The information indicates that if a UE is not provided a *pagingSearchSpace* for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, it does not monitor PDCCH for this set. Therefore, the UE's expectations regarding the monitoring of PDCCH candidates would be affected by the absence of this search space.\n\n3. **CORESET with Index 0**: The presence or absence of the CORESET with index 0 is crucial because it defines the resources allocated for the monitoring. If the UE is monitoring PDCCH in Type1, it is likely to expect some level of structure in the available resources, including whether SS/PBCH blocks are present.\n\n4. **SS/PBCH Blocks**: The UE's ability to monitor and the expectation regarding SS/PBCH blocks is tied to the active DL BWP and how it relates to the CORESET.\n\nGiven that the UE is actively monitoring PDCCH through Type1 but not through Type2, it is reasonable to conclude that the UE would expect the active DL BWP to include the necessary components for effective communication, including the presence of SS/PBCH blocks and the CORESET with index 0, which are essential for the monitoring process.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical conclusion is:\n\ncorrect option: 3"
