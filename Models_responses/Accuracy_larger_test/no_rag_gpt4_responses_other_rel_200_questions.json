        "response": "To determine which option is NOT a condition for efficient wireless power transfer, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n1. **High gain of the receiver antenna**: High gain in the receiver antenna helps to capture more of the transmitted power, which is essential for efficient power transfer. This condition is indeed important.\n\n2. **Directivity towards the transmitter**: For efficient power transfer, the receiver needs to be directed towards the transmitter to maximize the signal capture. This is also an important condition.\n\n3. **Alignment with the received E-field**: Proper alignment with the electric field (E-field) of the transmitted signal is crucial for maximizing the received power. This is another important condition.\n\n4. **Random polarization of the received signal**: Efficient wireless power transfer typically requires matching the polarization of the transmitted signal with that of the receiving antenna. Random polarization would lead to inefficient power transfer as it would not align with the transmitted signal's polarization.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that does NOT represent a condition for efficient wireless power transfer is:\n\ncorrect option: 4"

        "answer": "option 2: EE decreases monotonically with SE",
        "response": "To analyze the relationship between Energy Efficiency (EE) and Spectral Efficiency (SE) when circuit power consumption is ignored, we need to consider how these two metrics typically interact in communication systems.\n\n1. **Energy Efficiency (EE)** is defined as the ratio of the data rate (throughput) to the total energy consumed. In a scenario where circuit power consumption is ignored, we primarily consider the power used for transmission.\n\n2. **Spectral Efficiency (SE)** is defined as the data rate transmitted per unit bandwidth. Increasing SE usually involves using more advanced modulation techniques or coding schemes, which can allow for more bits to be transmitted over the same bandwidth.\n\nWhen circuit power consumption is ignored, the total power consumed is mainly related to the power used for transmission. As SE increases (for example, by increasing the modulation order), the data rate increases, which can lead to higher energy efficiency up to a certain point. \n\nHowever, as we push the limits of SE by employing more complex modulation techniques or increasing the transmission power, there comes a point where the additional energy required to maintain that higher SE might not yield a proportional increase in EE. This results in a peak where EE increases with SE until a threshold is reached, after which further increases in SE could lead to a decrease in EE due to inefficiencies or increased power requirements.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct relationship can be summarized as follows: EE increases with SE until a certain threshold, after which it may start to decrease. This leads us to option 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\ncorrect option: 4"

Each symbol can thus encode 4 bits of information since \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\nNow, we need to relate this to bits per Hertz (bits/Hz). The bandwidth of a QAM signal is typically considered to be equivalent to the symbol rate. In a basic setup without any additional coding or compression, the bit rate (in bits) can be directly related to the symbol rate (in symbols per second) and the number of bits per symbol.\n\nSince 16-QAM encodes 4 bits per symbol, the bit rate in bits per second is 4 times the symbol rate in symbols per second.

        "answer": "option 2: Cache popular files",
        "response": "To determine the optimum caching strategy for static user terminals, we need to consider the nature of static user terminals and their usage patterns.\n\n1. **No caching**: This option would mean that every request goes to the server, leading to high latency and increased load on the server. This is not efficient.\n\n2. **Cache popular files**: This strategy focuses on storing files that are frequently accessed by users. Since user terminals are static, it is likely that certain files will be requested more often than others. By caching popular files, we can reduce load times and improve the user experience without wasting resources on less frequently used files.\n\n3. **Cache all files**: While this would ensure that any file can be accessed quickly, it is not practical due to storage limitations and the potential for wasting resources on files that are seldom accessed. It is not an efficient use of caching.\n\n4. **Cache files at random**: Random caching does not leverage any usage patterns and could result in frequently accessed files not being cached while less accessed files take up space. This approach is also inefficient.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best option is to cache popular files, as it optimizes the use of storage while enhancing access speed for frequently requested content.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is: \ncorrect option: 2"

        "answer": "option 2: Low control-plane overheads and high user-plane QoS",
        "response": "In Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, there is a fundamental tradeoff between control-plane overheads and user-plane Quality-of-Service (QoS). \n\n1. **Control-plane overheads** refer to the resources and bandwidth consumed by the management and signaling functions within the network. High control-plane overhead means that more resources are being used for network management rather than for data transmission.\n\n2. **User-plane QoS** indicates the quality of the data transfer for end-users, which can include metrics like latency, bandwidth, jitter, and packet loss.\n\nIn general, when you increase the control-plane overheads (by implementing more sophisticated management protocols or more frequent updates to the control plane), it can lead to less bandwidth being available for user-plane traffic, thereby degrading the user-plane QoS. Conversely, if you minimize control-plane overheads (by reducing management complexity or frequency), you can allocate more resources for user-plane traffic, which improves QoS.\n\nThus, the relationship can be summarized as follows:\n\n- High control-plane overheads can lead to low user-plane QoS.\n- Low control-plane overheads can facilitate high user-plane QoS.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct option that reflects this tradeoff is:\n\ncorrect option: 1"

Higher intensity causes a greater phase shift.\n\n2. **Phase Shift**: As the pulse travels through the medium, different frequency components of the pulse experience different phase shifts due to their varying intensities.\n\n3. **Spectral Broadening**: The result of these varying phase shifts is that the pulse experiences a change in its frequency components. Specifically, it leads to the generation of new frequency components around the original frequency, causing the spectrum to broaden.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, SPM leads to an increase in the bandwidth of the pulse's frequency spectrum.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\ncorrect option: 2"

        "response": "To determine the effect on the capacity of a MIMO channel with receiver CSI when the transmit power constraint and the bandwidth are both doubled, we can refer to the Shannon capacity formula for a MIMO channel.

Specifically, if we analyze the capacity growth with respect to both parameters, we can see that:\n\n- When power is doubled, capacity increases.\n- When bandwidth is doubled, the overall capacity increases as well.\n\nIn general, when both power and bandwidth are doubled, the effect on the capacity can be shown to result in a total increase of capacity. Therefore, the capacity approximately quadruples overall, assuming the channel conditions remain the same.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\ncorrect option: 4"
