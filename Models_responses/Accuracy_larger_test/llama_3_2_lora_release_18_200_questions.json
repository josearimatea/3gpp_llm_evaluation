Therefore, V-EASDF should support DNS\nover (D)TLS, as specified in IETF RFC 7858 \\[17\\] and IETF RFC 8310\n\\[18\\]. The V-EASDF that are deployed within the 3GPP network can\nenforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS. The core network configures the\nV-EASDF security information to the UE as follows: the V-SMF can be\npreconfigured with the V-EASDF security information, or fetch the\ninformation from the V-EASDF. And then V-SMF provides the V-EASDF\nsecurity information to UE directly (i.e. LBO case), or via H-SMF (i.e.\ncase where HR SBO is authorized by HPLMN), during the PDU session\nestablishment or during modification procedure when the V-SMF determines\nto use a new V-EASDF for EAS discovery.  \nIf the core network is used for V-EASDF security information\nprovisioning, the V-SMF provides the V-EASDF security information to UE\ndirectly (i.e. LBO case) or via H-SMF (i.e. LBO case) during the PDU\nsession establishment or modification procedure when the V-SMF\ndetermines to use V-EASDF for EAS discovery.\n\nInformation 5:\nthe source address from V-EASDF to H-DNS server in the DNS response\nbased on the V-SMF instructions and sends this DNS response to the UE\nvia V-UL-CL.  \n15\\. For traffic charging between UE and V-EAS, V-PSA collects and\nreports the charging information based on the corresponding URR.  \n#### 6.3.2.2 EAS rediscovery procedure in roaming scenario  \nThe support for EAS rediscovery indication procedure enables the UE to\nrefresh stale EAS information stored locally so that the UE can trigger\nEAS discovery procedure to discover new EAS information as described in\nclause6.2.3.3 of TS23.548\\[3\\]. The corresponding EAS rediscovery\nprocedure is shown in figure6.3.2.2-1:  \nFigure6.3.2.2-1: EAS rediscovery procedure accessing V-EHE in roaming\nscenario  \n0\\. The procedure in clause6.3.2.1 executes with following difference\nto apply to EAS rediscovery:  \nIn step1, the UE may indicate its support for refreshing stale EAS\ninformation stored locally corresponding to the impact field per the EAS\nrediscovery indication from network to the V-SMF during the HR PDU\nSession Establishment procedure.  \nNOTE1: If the UE indicates such support, V-SMF may store this\nindication in the PDU Session context.  \n1a. Due to the UE mobility the V-SMF triggers V-PSA insertion, change or\nremoval for the PDU Session. The insertion, change or removal of V-PSA\ntriggers EAS rediscovery.  \nNOTE2: This solution does not cover EAS rediscovery scenario triggered\nby AF.  \n2\\. V- SMF sends PDU Session Modification Command (EAS rediscovery\nindication, \\[impact field\\]) to UE as described in step2 of\nclause6.2.3.3 of TS23.548\\[3\\], with the following differences:  \nV-SMF sends the impact field with the EAS rediscovery indication if the\nUE supports this indication.  \nIf V-SMF chooses new V-EASDF for the PDU Session, it does not provide\nthe V-EASDF IP address to UE.

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 4a.5.9 Bearer Control Mode Selection  \nWhen bearer binding is performed at the BBERF, the BBERF may indicate,\nvia the Gxx reference point, a request for Bearer Control Mode (BCM)\nselection at Gateway Control session establishment. It will be done\nusing the Gateway Control and QoS rule request procedure.  \nWhen applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF shall supply at Gateway\nControl Session Establishment, if information about the support of\nnetwork initiated procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support\nAVP in the CC-Request with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value\n\\\"INITIAL\\_REQUEST\\\". The Network-Request-Support AVP indicates the\naccess network support of the network requested bearer control.  \nThe PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the\nreceived Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information,\nsubscriber information and operator policy. If the selected bearer\ncontrol mode is UE\\_NW, the PCRF shall decide what mode (UE or NW) shall\napply for every QoS rule.  \nNOTE: For operator-controlled services, the UE and the PCRF may be\nprovisioned with information indicating which mode is to be used.  \nIf the BBERF provided the Network-Request-Support AVP, the PCRF shall\nprovide the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP to the BBERF using the\nGateway Control and QoS Rules provision procedure at Gateway Control\nsession establishment. The selected value will be applicable for the\nwhole Gateway Control session.  \nWhen the bearer binding function is changed from the PCEF to the BBERF,\nthe BBERF may indicate, via the Gxx reference point, a request for\nBearer Control Mode (BCM) selection at Gateway Control Session\nEstablishment as described above.  \nIn multiple BBERFs case, each BBERF may indicate a request for Bearer\nControl Mode selection independently and the BCM selected for each BBERF\nmay be different.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 7.8.3 Bearer related context  \nThe bearer context is realized over Sx by generating one or two\nForwarding Action Rules, a Usage Reporting Rule and a QoS Enforcement\nRule that correspond to the bearer. In particular, the CP function may\nprovide to the UP function for each active bearer:  \n\\- A Usage Reporting Rule that describes the reporting requirement for\nthe bearer, including reporting events, measurement type etc for the\nbearer reports.  \n\\- A QoS Enforcement Rule that describe the QoS enforcement actions that\napply to the bearer, including the bearer MBR.  \n\\- Forwarding Action Rules describe the forwarding behaviour for the\nbearer. One Forwarding Action Rule is required for the downlink\ndirection (in case of PGW or SGW) and one for the uplink direction (in\ncase of SGW).  \nNOTE: The CP function maintains the association between the EPS Bearer\nID and the rules on Sx corresponding to bearer level enforcement and\nreports. There is no need to provide a Bearer ID to the UP function.  \nThe CP function associates, based on the bearer binding decisions, every\nPacket Detection Rule that is activated for a bearer with the URR, QER\nand FARs applicable for the this bearer by including references (Rule\nIDs) in the PDR:  \n\\- For bearer level reporting, the CP function includes a reference\n(Rule ID) to the URR for the bearer.  \n\\- For bearer level policing, the CP function includes a reference (Rule\nID) to the QER for the bearer.  \n\\- For forwarding of packets over a bearer (GTP-U encapsulation), the CP\nfunction includes a reference (Rule ID) to the FAR the bearer. This is\ndone per direction (UL and DL).\n\nInformation 3:\n### 4.2.1 Bearer services  \nThe characterisation of a bearer service is made by using a set of\ncharacteristics that distinguishes it from other bearer services.\nParticular values are assigned to each characteristic when a given\nbearer service is described and defined.  \nThe service characteristics as they apply at a given reference point\nwhere the user accesses the bearer service.  \nIn the general case networks between the two access points use different\ncontrol mechanisms. In this case the bearer services of each network\nthroughout the communication link have to be translated at the network\ninterfaces to realize an end to end bearer service.  \nA list of definitions of attributes and values used for bearer services\nis contained in clause 5.  \nThe bearer services are negotiable and can be used flexibly by\napplications.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 2.5.1 Provision of bearer service  \nProvision of bearer service is a parameter identifying whether a bearer\nservice is provisioned to the mobile subscriber or not. This provision\ncan be achieved through subscription of the mobile subscriber or the\nbearer service can be generally available. The parameter \\\"provision of\nbearer service\\\" must be set for the bearer service defined in\n3GPPTS22.002\\[2\\] for which a subscription is required.  \nProvision of bearer service is permanent subscriber data and is stored\nin the HLR and VLR.\n\nInformation 5:\nIn this scenario, ~~bearer~~[MC service resource]{.underline} control is\nperformed by the MC service server alone, as shown in figure9.2.2.3.3-1\nbelow. [Either the N5 interface or the Rx interface is used between the\nMC service server and the PCF in 5GS.]{.underline}  \nFigure9.2.2.3.3-1: ~~Bearer~~[MC service resource]{.underline} control\nby MC service server\n\nQuestion: What is the role of the bearer control function?

Any user wishing to use the services of a particular\nserving network would register with that serving network, that would\neither directly or indirectly interwork with the home environment. Fraud\nand cost control mechanisms shall be used to ensure that charges\nincurred for 3GPP services do not exceed the credit limits set. This can\nbe applied for the user and the other roles involved in commercial\ndealings.

A number of\nalternative routes may be possible, and ideally the system should be\ncapable of determining the lowest cost to the end user.  \nTypically, smaller networks will only have a limited number of external\nconnections to other networks or clearing houses, but may not know which\none to use for an unknown (new) HE. In this case, the serving network\nmay make a number of inquiries for each route to determine the lowest\ncost route to handle the call.  \n8.2 Settlement of charges\n-------------------------  \nSettlement of charges incurred by a user shall be on a wholesale basis\nbetween the different parties involved in the registration link.

\nThis use case involves MPS activation for all participants (i.e.,\nparticipants with MPS subscribed UEs and public UEs) of an MMTEL voice\nconference call initiated by the conference host (i.e., MPS Service\nUser). The MMTEL voice conference host (i.e., MPS Service User) invokes\nMPS to request priority for all participants of an MMTEL voice\nconference call when the MPS Service User is aware that normal voice\nconference service is degraded (e.g., the normal MMTEL voice conference\ncall cannot be established), or when an ongoing MMTEL voice conference\ncall becomes unacceptable for any conference participant (e.g., due to\nnetwork congestion), the MPS Service User invokes MPS to upgrade the\nentire MMTEL voice conference call to obtain priority treatment for all\nparticipants.  \nWhen the conference host (i.e., MPS Service User) cannot gain access to\nthe MMTEL voice conference server, MPS for MMTEL voice described in\nclause 5.4 may be used by the host to obtain priority access to the\nconference server or in the case of a multimedia conference, MPS for DTS\nas described in clause 6.1 may be used to obtain priority data access to\nthe conference server.  \nThe invocation of MPS for all participants of an MMTEL voice conference\ncall is done using a customized feature of the voice conference service\n(available only to the host) that indicates a request for priority to\nthe MPS capable 3GPP system.  \nThe MPS Service Provider PLMN authenticates and authorizes the MPS\nsubscriber's use of MPS conference invocation to apply to all\nparticipants of the MMTEL voice conference call.  \nPriority treatment is provided for the signalling and once MPS is\nestablished for all participants of the MMTEL voice conference call,\npriority treatment is provided for the audio media flows of all\nparticipants on the MMTEL voice conference call.  \nNOTE 1: The difference between this use case and the basic use case of\nMPS MMTEL voice conference is that in this case, MPS is invoked by a\n\nInformation 5:\n-   upon end of an MPS MMTEL voice call, or an MPS MMTEL voice\n> conference call from a UE with an MPS subscription, and the UE\n> shall return to normal conditions (i.e., use of normal MMTEL voice\n> service),  \n-   upon end of an MPS MMTEL voice call, or an MPS MMTEL voice\n> conference call from a UE that does not have an MPS subscription,\n> and the UE shall return to normal conditions (i.e., use of normal\n> voice service), and  \n-   upon end of an MPS MMTEL voice conference call where MPS was\n> provided to all participants on the voice conference call, and the\n> UEs shall return to normal conditions (i.e., use of normal MMTEL\n> voice service).  \nThe 3GPP system shall revoke MPS for an individual participant leaving\nan ongoing MPS for MMTEL voice conference where MPS is activated for all\nparticipants.  \nWhen an MPS MMTEL voice call or an MPS MMTEL voice conference call is\nnot explicitly ended, upon UE detachment/deregistration (e.g., orderly\npower down), the system in the RPLMN shall automatically revoke MPS such\nthat MPS priority treatment shall not automatically apply to subsequent\ncalls upon subsequent registration.\n\nQuestion: What are the supported scenarios for MPS for MMTEL voice?

The\nexposed capabilities include the services of the Edge Enabler Layer and\nthe re-exposed and enhanced services of the 3GPP core network. The\ncapabilities exposed by the edge enabler layer are specified in\nclause8.6 and the 3GPP network capability exposure is specified in\nclause8.7. Other application layer capabilities like application\nenabler services and SEAL services may be exposed via edge enabler layer\nas per CAPIF as illustrated in Annex A.4.  \nThe edge enabler layer also supports for an EAS to expose its Service\nAPIs (i.e., EAS Service APIs) towards the other EASs via CAPIF as\nspecified in 3GPP TS 23.222 \\[6\\] by deploying CAPIF core function\nwithin the EES to support publish and discovery of EAS Service APIs. The\ndetails are provided in Annex A.5.4.  \n4.6 Support for service continuity\n----------------------------------  \nWhen a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable\nfor serving the UE. When no suitable EAS can be found for serving the\nUE, the service session may transition to a CAS. Such transitions can\nresult from a non-mobility event also, requiring support from the edge\nenabler layer to maintain the continuity of the service. Support for\nservice continuity provides several features for minimizing the\napplication layer service interruption by replacing the S-EAS connected\nto the AC in the UE, with a T-EAS or CAS. Support for service continuity\nis further specified in clause8.8.  \n4.7 Security\n------------  \nThe edge enabler layer supports secure communication amongst the enabler\nlayer entities. Clause8.11 provides details on EEC authentication and\nauthorization.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 5.2.4 EAS discovery  \n#### 5.2.4.1 General  \nThis clause specifies the requirements for EAS discovery.  \n#### 5.2.4.2 Requirements  \n\\[AR-5.2.4.2-a\\] The application layer architecture shall provide\nmechanisms for an EEC to discover available EASs.  \n\\[AR-5.2.4.2-b\\] The application layer architecture shall provide\nrelevant configuration information of the EASs to the EEC, in order to\nenable communication between ACs and the EASs.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.2.4 EAS discovery  \n#### 5.2.4.1 General  \nThis clause specifies the requirements for EAS discovery.  \n#### 5.2.4.2 Requirements  \n\\[AR-5.2.4.2-a\\] The application layer architecture shall provide\nmechanisms for an EEC to discover available EASs.  \n\\[AR-5.2.4.2-b\\] The application layer architecture shall provide\nrelevant configuration information of the EASs to the EEC, in order to\nenable communication between ACs and the EASs.\n\nInformation 4:\nof the EAS in the 3GPP Core Network, based on application KPIs and if\nthe EAS traffic influence was not done before (e.g. neither in EAS\ndiscovery procedure nor the EAS perform traffic influence).  \nWhen the selection is that of a common EAS for application group, the\nrequest message may contain the list of EESs for a certain Application\nGroup ID, received from the ECS in the service provisioning response\nmessage. This application group related information may be used for\nfurther common EAS announcement(s) between EES(s). In the case of no\nECS-ER, if the request message does not contain the list of EESs for a\ncertain Application Group ID, then the EES determines the other EESs to\nwhich announce common EAS request needs to be sent as described in\nclause 8.8.3.3. If there is ECS-ER, the EEC selected EAS is used in\ninteraction between the EES and ECS-ER, and EEC receives common EAS in\nthe EAS information provisioning response. If the common EAS is\nregistered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the\ncommon EAS is registered is also included in the EAS information\nprovisioning response.  \nIf the request contains the selected EASID and the selected EAS endpoint\nis not included, the EES verifies if instantiation of EAS is needed and\nmay trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS as in\nclause 8.12.  \nWhen the request contains EEC Service Continuity Support IE and the EEC\ncontext has been established, the EES includes the IE into the EEC\ncontext described in Table 8.2.8-1.  \n> NOTE2: EES can also influence the EAS traffic in advance.\n>\n> NOTE3: It is up to the AC to decide when to connect to the selected\n> EAS (either immediately or wait for a while) once the AC knows the\n> selected EAS.  \n3\\.

EEC may\nsend EAS discovery to multiple EESs. If registration is required by an\nEES, EEC registers into the EES before EAS discovery.  \nIn step 3, the EEC (or AC and EEC) selects the initial EAS from the\ndiscovered EAS candidates.  \nIn step 4, the EEC sends Selected EAS declaration request with AC ID,\nEAS ID, EAS endpoint and UE ID to the selected EES (which is determined\nbased on the selected EAS).  \nThe EES, in step 5:  \n\\- may apply the EAS traffic influence with the N6 routing information\nof the EAS in the 3GPP Core Network, based on application KPIs and if\nthe EAS traffic influence was not done before.  \nNOTE1: EES can also influence the EAS traffic in advance.  \nThe EEC is then responded by the selected EES with success/failure of\nthe request in step 6.  \nNOTE2: It is up to the AC to decide when to connect to the selected EAS\n(either immediately or wait for a while) once the AC knows the selected\nEAS.  \nNOTE3: The AC is not depicted in above figure for simplicity and\nsolution to address interaction between AC and EEC is related to KI\\#4\nfor step 1 to 3.  \nTable7.15.2-1 describes information elements for the selected EAS\nannouncement request sent from the EEC to the serving EES.  \nTable7.15.2-1: Selected EAS announcement request  \n----------------------- -------- -------------------------------\nInformation element     Status   Description\nUE ID                   M        The identifier of the UE.\nAC ID                   O        The Application Client ID.\nSecurity credentials    M        Security credentials.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the EAS discovery in the application layer architecture?

Redundant paths may be established using FRER on\nthe paths through the two UPFs. This eliminates single points of service\nfailure in the end-to-end path except for the UE.  \nIn addition, 23.501 Annex F (informative) describes how redundant user\nplane paths based on multiple UEs per device can be realized. That\napproach uses UE Reliability Groups to provide redundancy by configuring\nindependent paths through different gNB cells. The approach includes:  \n\\- Separate gNBs for each user plane path  \n\\- Terminal devices that integrate multiple UEs which can connect to\ndifferent gNBs independently.  \n\\- Redundant RAN coverage  \n\\- UPF and Transport aligned with the RAN, with separated, redundant\nuser plane paths  \n\\- Separate Core Network Control Plane (e.g.: AMF, SMF) for the UEs  \n\\- Operation of the redundant user plane paths is made sufficiently\nindependent, to the extent deemed necessary by the operator, e.g.,\nindependent power supplies  \nThe approach increases reliability by creating parallel communication\npaths that are as independent as possible. It however does not\ncoordinate 5GS controllable events that increase the likelihood of path\ndisruption so they do not occur simultaneously.\n\nQuestion: Which solutions in LTE support configurable reliability and latency combinations?

For BCS1,\nthe uplink configuration supports CA configuration CA\\_n2A-n66A.  \n\\- For some configurations, there are regional spectrum limitations to\nthe corresponding bands and the notes can be found in the configuration\ntable, such as for CA\\_n2A-n48A, the channel bandwidths 50MHz, 60MHz,\n80MHz, 90MHz and 100MHz are applicable only to downlink.  \nFor channel bandwidth per operating band defined in clause 5.3.5 of TS\n38.101-1/-2 and TS 38.104, Table 8.3.1.1-2 illustrates that,  \n\\- The requirements for each configuration should be complied with the\ncombination of channel bandwidths, SCS for each operating band defined\nin the table.\n\nInformation 3:\n+--------------+--------------+---------+--------------+--------------+  \nThe following notes are applied to the above tables:  \nNOTE 1: This UE channel bandwidth is optional in this release of the\nspecification.

The scope\nincludes development of specifications for:  \n**System level evaluation.**  \nWithin this category, a list of four focus areas are identified, however\nthe emphasis of the SCM AHG work is on items a and b.  \na\\) Physical parameters (e.g. power delay profiles, angle spreads,\ndependencies between parameters)  \nb\\) System evaluation methodology.  \nc\\) Antenna arrangements, reference cases and definition of minimum\nrequirements.  \nd\\) Some framework (air interface) dependent parameters.  \n**Link level evaluation.**  \nThe link level models are defined only for calibration purposes. It is a\ncommon view within the group that the link level simulation assumptions\nwill not be used for evaluation and comparison of proposals.  \n2 References\n============  \nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in\nthis text, constitute provisions of the present document.  \n\\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\nedition number, version number, etc.) or non\u2011specific.  \n\\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.  \n\\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

Additionally with FLO in *Iu mode*, the physical layer\noffers a transmission service on transport channels. The BS and MS\naccess capabilities and the characteristics of logical channels (SAPs)\nare defined in 3GPP TS 44.003.  \nNOTE: Between 3GPP TS 44.003 and the 3GPP TS 45.0xx series there is a\nslight difference in terminology. The \\\"channels\\\" mentioned in 3GPP TS\n44.003 are \\\"logical channels\\\" according to the 3GPP TS 45.0xx series\n(especially 3GPP TS 45.002). The \\\"CCCH\\\", a channel name commonly used\nin the 3GPP TS 44.0xx series, covers the logical channels of the type\nRACH, PCH and AGCH. Similarly, the \\\"PCCCH\\\" covers the logical channels\nof the type PPCH, PAGCH and PRACH.  \nFor an MS operating in *A/Gb mode*, logical channels are multiplexed on\nphysical channels. Physical channels are the units scheduled on the\nradio medium. Some are reserved by the network for common use (e.g. a\ncombination of CCCH and BCCH), others are assigned to dedicated\nconnections with MSs (dedicated physical channels), or are assigned to a\nshared usage between MSs for packet switched data traffic (packet data\nphysical channels). In time, the combination of logical channels used on\nan assigned physical channel may change. Allowed combinations of logical\nchannels on a physical channel are defined in 3GPP TS 44.003. Data on\nSAPs of control channels is exchanged in discrete blocks with a size of\n23 or 21 (SACCH) octets. Data on a SAP of packet data traffic channels\nis exchanged in discrete blocks with a size dependent on the block type\n(see clause 7).  \nFor an MS operating in *Iu mode*, logical channels are multiplexed on\nbasic physical subchannels. Basic physical subchannels are the units\nscheduled on the radio medium. Some basic physical channels are reserved\nby the network for common use (e.g. BCCH); dedicated basic physical\nsubchannels are assigned to dedicated connections with MSs, shared basic\n\nInformation 3:\nphysical layer techniques using the appropriate channel model(s).\nTherefore, the TR will be kept up-to-date via CRs in the future.  \nThis document relates to the 3GPP evaluation methodology and covers the\nmodelling of the physical layer of both Mobile Equipment and Access\nNetwork of 3GPP systems.  \nThis document is intended to capture the channel model(s) for\nfrequencies from 0.5GHz up to 100GHz.  \n2 References\n============  \nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in\nthis text, constitute provisions of the present document.  \n\\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\nedition number, version number, etc.) or non\u2011specific.  \n\\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.  \n\\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

Maximum duration the SDT procedure can last\nis dictated by a SDT failure detection timer that is configured by the\nnetwork (see clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 \\[12\\]).  \nSDT procedure is initiated with either a transmission over RACH\n(configured via system information) or over Type 1 CG resources\n(configured via dedicated signalling in *RRCRelease*). The SDT resources\ncan be configured on initial BWP for both RACH and CG.

The initial AMF optionally performs horizontal Kamf derivation of\nKamf-0 to generate a new Kamf-1. The option to perform horizontal Kamf\nderivation depends on local configuration and whether the old AMF has\nperformed horizontal key derivation. If the initial AMF is configured to\nperform horizontal key derivation the initial AMF only performs\nhorizontal key derivation if the old AMF does not perform one. If the\ninitial AMF is not configured to perform horizontal key derivation then\nthe initial AMF does not perform any horizontal key derivation. This\nstep would ensure that the target AMF has no access to the Kamf-0 key\nused by the initial AMF. If the Initial AMF performs horizontal Kamf\nderivation then the initial AMF resets the corresponding uplink and\ndownlink NAS COUNTs.  \nNote 3: Backward security is not addressed here in case the initial AMF\ndecides not to perform horizontal key derivation.  \n7\\. The initial AMF encrypts the security context (including Kamf-0 or\nKamf-1), the keyAmfHDerivationInd indicator and potentially other\nparameters (e.g. UL/DL NAS COUNTs if horizontal key derivation was\nperformed in Step 6) with the Kamfreal and creates a protected 5G NAS\nsecurity context container. The initial AMF may integrity protect the 5G\nNAS security context container using an addition integrity protection\nkey Kamfreal\\_int obtained by the NSSF in step 5 or generate a pair of\nkeys (encryption and integrity protection based on the Kamfreal key.\nWith respect to the protection algorithm(s) there are multiple\nalternatives. The protection algorithm(s) could be assumed to static and\nknown to all the AMFs. Or the initial AMF could select one of the\nalgorithms from a set and indicate the algorithm information in the\nSteps 8-9 in the protected 5G security context container. The NAS\nprotection algorithms could be used for the protection of the 5G NAS\nsecurity context container with parameters to be determined in the\nnormative phase.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 6.2.2 Solution details  \nBefore the Initial AMF re-routes the Registration Request (RR) message\nand the 5G NAS security context, the Initial AMF performs horizontal\nKamf derivation of the current Kamf-0 and generates a new Kamf-1 key\nwhich is then routed via RAN to the Target AMF together with an\nindication of horizontal K~AMF~ derivation (i.e. keyAmfHDerivationInd).\nThe current Kamf-0 is not rerouted via RAN to the Target AMF. This would\nensure that the Target AMF has no access to the Kamf-0 key used in the\nInitial AMF/old AMF.  \nThe Initial AMF forwards the RR message, the 5G NAS security context\nincluding the Kamf-1 and the keyAmfHDerivationInd indicator unprotected\nto the Target AMF via RAN.  \nThe new generated Kamf-1 key could be seen as a one-time key for the\npurpose of the AMF re-allocation. It is worth noting that Kamf-1 is\npractically useless to a legitimate RAN node since it is a NAS key that\nhas not been put into use by any AMF in the network. The Target AMF\nwould then be mandated to establish a new further key Kamf-2 with the\nUE, which is not available to the Initial AMF and the RAN.  \nBecause the Target AMF has received the keyAmfHDerivationInd indicator,\nthe Target AMF needs to run a NAS SMC procedure with the UE, to take the\nnew Kamf-1 key into use with the UE. The Target AMF is also mandated to\ninitiate a new primary authentication with the UE to derive a new Kamf-2\nwhen it has received the RR message from the RAN. The new primary\nauthentication procedure is protected by the Kamf-1. This step would\nensure that the Initial AMF has no access to the new Kamf-2 key (i.e.\nthe Kamf key used in the Target AMF and the UE).  \nAs the target AMF can determine that a NAS re-route via RAN has taken\nplace, the target AMF needs to restrict the use of the Kamf-1 only for\nthe purpose of sending protected NAS Security Mode Command and\nAuthentication Challenge/Request to the UE, and for receiving protected\n\nInformation 3:\n\\- Keys for NAS signalling:  \n\\- K~NASint~ is a key derived by ME and AMF from K~AMF~, which shall\nonly be used for the protection of NAS signalling with a particular\nintegrity algorithm;  \n\\- K~NASenc~ is a key derived by ME and AMF from K~AMF~, which shall\nonly be used for the protection of NAS signalling with a particular\nencryption algorithm.  \nKey for gNB:  \n\\- K~gNB~ is a key derived by ME and AMF from K~AMF~.

The SMF selects the PDU session(s) and the UPFs it has to send the\nrequest to. The SMF sends the request to the UPF including the UPF event\nconsumer address, Notification Correlation Information, Event Filter\nInformation, Reporting suggestion information, Target of Event Reporting\nand Target Subscription Information as required. Target of Event\nReporting is a certain UE. The interaction mechanism used between SMF\nand UPF depends on UPF exposure event and which mechanism applies for\neach event as described in clause5.2.26.2.1. For some events, the SMF\nshall contact UPF (4a) with N4 Session Modification with PFCP\n(TS29.244\\[69\\]), for other events (4b) with Nupf\\_event exposure\nsubscribe request (as defined in clause5.2.26.2.3).  \nNOTE2: Some events can require SMF interacts with RAN at this stage.  \n5\\. Per Reporting suggestion information (if available), the UPF sends\nthe locally collected UPF data by invoking Nupf\\_EventExposure\\_Notify\nservice operation to the UPF event consumer.  \n##### 4.15.4.5.3 Information flow for UPF event exposure service for any UE  \nFigure 4.15.4.5.3-1: UPF Information Exposure to the UPF event consumer\n(e.g. NWDAF) of any UE scenario  \n1\\.

The UPF event consumer triggers the SMFs/UPFs discovery to NRF by\nNnrf\\_NFDiscovery\\_Request providing the DNN, S-NSSAI, DNAI etc. This\nprocedure is to discover the related SMFs/UPFs associated with any UE\nand support the indicated DNAI. SMF or UPF(s) are discovered depending\non whether the subscription request to UPF events meets the criteria for\ndirect subscription to UPF as defined in clause5.8.2 of\nTS23.501\\[2\\]).  \n5\\.

The record of each individual\ntransaction shall be reported to the home environment at short time\nintervals in order to allow further processing by the billing system in\nthe Home Environment, provide itemised bills, and to deal with any\ndisputes regarding charges both for users and for other visited networks\nand home environment.  \nThe standard shall support the transfer of charging data at different\nintervals as required by the Home Environment (e.g. short time\nintervals, real time, other regular intervals).  \n7.1 Delegation of charging authority\n------------------------------------  \nThe registration process allows the home environment to authenticate\nusers before they incur any charges.

Service load can be determined by considering both NF(s) load in\n5GC and network utilization in access network. If the service\ndegradation occurs or is predicted when the network capacity is\ndecreased, network capacity could be increased to solve the issue.\nTherefore, it is necessary for the 3GPP management system to configure\nthe 5GC functions such that in the event of a potential service\ndegradation or prediction of overloading, a notification is sent to the\n3GPP management system. This can be done by configuring the overloading\nconditions (e.g. triggering parameters) in the 5GC functions for a\nselected service. The 3GPP management system could configure the 5GC\nfunctions to trigger when the service load is increased or predicted to\nbe increased beyond a certain threshold level. The 3GPP management\nsystem could then increase the network capacity or use an MDAS to find a\nproper solution.  \nSimilarly, when the network resources are underutilized the 3GPP\nmanagement system could decrease the network capacity.  \n**REQ-CSA\\_RR-CON-01** The 3GPP management system shall be able to\nconfigure the 5GC functions to enable reporting of a potential service\nload increase beyond a certain threshold so that the 3GPP management\nsystem can increase the network resource capacity in time without\nimpacting the SLS.  \n**REQ-CSA\\_RR-CON-02** The 3GPP management system shall be able to\ndetermine the service load thresholds that need to be used by the 5GC\nfunctions to report, so that a potential network resource\noverprovisioning situation can be ascertained.  \n**REQ-CSA\\_RR-CON-03** The 3GPP management system shall be able to\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.8.2 Functional Description  \nThe solution assumes that the UEs have temporarily selected and\nregistered with a hosting network for utilizing localized service, and\nthat the UEs at some point leave the hosting network and return to their\nhome network. The home network in this case can be a PLMN (HPLMN or\nVPLMN) or an SNPN.  \nThe mechanism for Control Plane Load Control is a comparatively slow\nmechanism. It does not adapt quickly to changes of signalling load. The\npurpose of the mechanism is to distribute the load in relation to the\nrelative capacity of the involved Network Functions. The load\ndistribution is based on Weight Factors in AMFs.  \nAMF Control of Overload involves activation of NAS level congestion\ncontrol, which is based on providing UEs with back-off time values. The\nUEs use the back-off time values to decide when to initiate NAS\nsignalling. By providing different back-off time values to different\nUEs, the UE-initiated NAS-signalling is expected to be distributed over\ntime, thereby reducing the peak signalling load. NAS level congestion\ncontrol is described in clause5.19.7 of TS23.501\\[3\\].\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of control plane load control, congestion and overload control in the 5G System?

The delivery of UE Parameters Update Data to the UE via control\nplane procedure is also conveyed using this notification, as defined in\n3GPPTS23.502\\[3\\] clause4.20.The notification request shall be sent\nto the callbackReference URI as previously received in the\nSdmSubscription (see clause 6.1.6.2.3).  \nFigure 5.2.2.5.2-1: Subscription Data Change Notification  \n1\\. The UDM sends a POST request to the callbackReference as provided by\nthe NF service consumer during the subscription.  \n2a. On success, the NF service consumer responds with \\\"204 No\nContent\\\".  \n2b. On failure or redirection, one of the appropriate HTTP status code\nlisted in Table 6.1.5.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the\nmessage body may contain appropriate additional error information.  \nNOTE 1: If the NF service consumer detects that the received Data Change\nNotification contains an origValue that does not match the currently\nstored value, it can re-sync by using the Nudm\\_SDM\\_Get service\noperation.  \nNOTE 2: When the notification is used for the delivery of UE Parameter\nUpdate Data to the UE, the trigger for UDM to start this procedure is\nout of the scope of this specification. This can be based, e.g., on O&M\ncommands or provisioning orders. When a given UE parameter can be\nupdated either in the USIM or in the ME side of the UE (e.g., Routing\nIndicator, see 3GPPTS23.502\\[3\\] clause4.20.1) it is assumed that\nthe trigger for the UE parameter update procedure includes an indication\nto the UDM of the target for the UE parameters update (i.e., USIM or\nME). This indication is used by the UDM to decide which UE parameter\nupdate data set type to use and whether the UE parameter update requires\nsecured packet protection via SP-AF.  \n##### 5.2.2.5.3 UDR-initiated Data Restoration Notification  \nFigure 5.2.2.5.3-1 shows a scenario where the UDM notifies the NF\n\nInformation 4:\nthe PDU Session.  \n13\\. SMF notifies any entity that has subscribed to User Location\nInformation related with PDU Session change.  \n14\\. If it is the last PDU Session the SMF is handling for the UE for\nthe associated (DNN, S-NSSAI), the SMF unsubscribes from Session\nManagement Subscription data changes notification with the UDM by means\nof the Nudm\\_SDM\\_Unsubscribe (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI) service operation.\nThe UDM may unsubscribe the subscription notification from UDR by\nNudr\\_DM\\_Unsubscribe (SUPI, Subscription Data, Session Management\nSubscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI).  \n15\\. The SMF invokes the Nudm\\_UECM\\_Deregistration service operation\nincluding the DNN and the PDU Session Id. The UDM removes the\nassociation it had stored between the SMF identity and the associated\nDNN and PDU Session Id. The UDM may update this information by\nNudr\\_DM\\_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data, UE context in SMF data).  \n#### 4.3.4.3 UE or network requested PDU Session Release for Home-routed Roaming  \nThis procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios.  \nFigure 4.3.4.3-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for\nhome-routed roaming  \n1\\. The procedure is triggered by one of the following events:  \n1a. (UE initiated release) As in step 1a of clause4.3.4.2 with the\naddition that:  \n\\- the V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to\nstop forwarding uplink traffic; and  \n\\- the V-SMF invokes the Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Update Request (SM Context\nID, information from the SM message from the UE e.g. PCO, \\\"Trigger PDU\nSession Release\\\" indication, Timezone, User Location Information)\nservice operation to request the H-SMF to release the PDU Session. The\nH-SMF responds to the request immediately.  \n1b. (Serving network initiated release) The serving network initiates\nthe PDU Session Release during UE or serving network initiated\nDeregistration procedure as specified in clause4.2.2.3.

For\nSPS PDSCH reception, type-2 CG PUSCH transmission, and SP-CSI reporting\non PUSCH, once BWP is switched, they should be reactivated by activation\nDCI.  \nTechnique B-2 supports enhancements to enable UE group-common or\ncell-specific BWP configuration and/or switching. Also supports\nenhancements to enable SPS PDSCH reception/Type-2 CG PUSCH\ntransmission/SP-CSI reporting on PUSCH without reactivation after the\nBWP switching.  \n#### 6.2.2.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact  \nThe following capture the results for semi-statically configured\nbandwidth part of UEs within a carrier. The evaluation is performed with\ndifferent traffic, e.g. medium traffic to light traffic for Set 1, and\nlow traffic to very low traffic for Set 3, and the reduced BW of 80 MHz\nis applied as NES mode compared with baseline BW of 100 MHz.  \nTable 6.2.2.2-1: BS energy savings by BWP adaptation within carrier  \n+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\n| **Co    | **BS    | **Load  | **ES    | **KPI   | **Re    | **B     |\n| mpany** | Cat     | sce     | gain    | (%:     | ference | aseline |\n|         | egory** | nario** | (%)**   | loss    | c       | confi   |\n|         |         |         |         | w.r.t.  | onfigur | guratio |\n|         |         |         |         | base    | ation** | n/assum |\n|         |         |         |         | line)** |         | ption** |\n+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+\n| **Sa    | Cat 1   | B       | 38.2%   | UPT:    | Set1    | Ba      |\n| msung** |         | aseline |         | 6.05%;  |         | seline: |\n|         |         | t       |         | Packet  |         | full    |\n| **\\     |         | raffic: |         | l       |         | 100MHz  |\n\nInformation 4:\nBWP could achieve BS energy savings by up to 1.75%, and 1 source shows\nnegative energy saving gains (i.e. energy consumption increase) up to\n75.4% with significant UPT loss (up to 88%).  \n\\- Evaluation of all techniques is based on the baseline BS power model\nin Clause 5.  \n\\- From RAN2 perspective, technique A-5-1/B-1-1 of SCell without SSB in\ninter-band CA and NES cell without SSB/SIB may need more detailed study\nin normative phase (if supported) with feasibility up to RAN1.

Technique C-2 also has\nthe potential to provide large network energy saving gain.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.2.3 Technique B-3 Adaptation of bandwidth of UE(s) within a BWP  \n#### 6.2.3.1 Description of technique  \nCurrently, a bandwidth of a BWP is semi-statically configured, and the\nbandwidth of the given BWP cannot be dynamically changed. The current\nBWP framework allows the UEs to be configured with a default BWP and\nswitching to a default BWP based on timer. Reduction of the frequency\nresources within a BWP can be achieved via configuration and scheduling\na the gNB.  \nTechnique B-3 supports enhancements to enable group-common signaling to\nadapt the bandwidth of active BWP and continue operating in same BWP.\nSome frequency resources within the active BWP may be deactivated.  \n#### 6.2.3.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact  \nThe following captures the results for dynamic /(semi)-static adaptation\nof bandwidth of active BWP.  \nTable 6.2.3.2-1: BS energy savings by BW adaptation within BWP  \n+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\n| **Co    | **ES    | **BS    | **Load  | **ES    | **KPI** | **B     |\n| mpany** | s       | Cat     | sce     | gain    |         | aseline |\n|         | cheme** | egory** | nario** | (%)**   |         | confi   |\n|         |         |         |         |         |         | guratio |\n|         |         |         |         |         |         | n/assum |\n|         |         |         |         |         |         | ption** |\n+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+=========+\n| **OPPO  | ada     | Cat 1   | low     | 1.4%    | UPT:    | system  |\n| \\       | ptation |         | load(   |         | 554.7   | BW of   |\n| [14\\]** | of      |         | RU-10%) |         | 4Mbps(- | 100MHz, |\n|         | ba      |         |         |         | 46.8%); | 64T:    |\n|         | ndwidth |         |         |         | Access  | (M, N,  |\n|         | of      |         |         |         | delay/l | P, Mg,  |\n\nQuestion: What is the observed range of BS energy savings when the traffic is reduced for BWP adaptation within a carrier?

However, it is possible to classify MBMS User Services\naccording to the method used to distribute these services.  \nThere are four types of MBMS User Service considered within this\nspecification.  \n\u2022 Streaming services  \n> A continuous data flow providing a stream of continuous media (i.e.\n> audio and video) is a basic MBMS User Service.

Still images may also be used\n> for banner images that advertise some product or service. These static\n> media need to be synchronized and displayed with audio/video streams.  \nNote: Streaming in the context of MBMS User Services may not be the same\nas that described e.g. within PSS \\[4\\].  \n\u2022 File download services  \n> This service delivers binary data (file data) over an MBMS bearer.

The TS 23.140 \\[23\\] identifies the functional\ncapabilities and information flows needed to support the MMS. The\npresent document provides the details of media types, formats and codecs\nused by the MMSservice  \nThe issue of codecs ad for MMS services has been addressed initially in\nTS 23.140, owned by the 3GPP T2 group. During the TSG-T WG2 group\nmeeting in Edinburgh in September 2001, the TSG-T WG2 group sent a\nLiaison statement (S4-AHP040) to the 3GPP SA WG4 group, requesting that\nthe responsibility for the specification of codecs and formats to be\nused in MMS services is transferred to SA WG4 group starting with\nRelease 5.  \nAfter the SA WG4 group agreed to take over this responsibility, and the\npresent document is the result of such commitment on Release 6.  \nFor the sake of interoperability and alignment it is important there is\nno contradiction between the recommendations made in the present\ndocument and in the 26.234 specification \\[14\\].  \n1 Scope\n=======  \nThe present document specifies the media types, formats and codecs for\nthe MMS within the 3GPP system.

When the decision to change cells is made,\nthe mobile station switches to the BCCH, PBCCH or EC-BCCH of the new\ncell. The broadcast information is then checked to verify the allowance\nto camp on this cell (cf. sub-clause3.2.2). Dependent on the mobile\nstation type and configuration, the mobile station may be required to\ntry to read further BCCH or PBCCH or EC-BCCH information. If allowed,\nthe cell change is confirmed, and the broadcast information is then\ntreated for Mobility Management actions (cf.clause 4). Similarly,\nphysical contexts are updated (list of neighbouring cells frequencies,\nthresholds for some actions, etc. (cf.3GPPTS45.008 and\nsub-clause3.2.2)).  \nA mobile station configured for Extended Access Barring (EAB) shall read\nthe SI3 Rest Octets IE in an attempt to determine if the SYSTEM\nINFORMATION TYPE 21 message is sent in the cell.

The\nparticular PLMN or SNPN to be contacted may be selected either\nautomatically or manually.  \nThe MS looks for a suitable cell of the chosen PLMN or SNPN and chooses\nthat cell to provide available services, and tunes to its control\nchannel. This choosing is known as \\\"camping on the cell\\\". The MS will\nthen register its presence in the registration area of the chosen cell\nif necessary, by means of a location registration (LR), GPRS attach,\nIMSI attach or registration procedure.  \nIf the MS loses coverage of a cell, or find a more suitable cell, it\nreselects onto the most suitable cell of the selected PLMN or SNPN and\ncamps on that cell. If the new cell is in a different registration area,\nan LR request is performed.  \nIf the MS loses coverage of a PLMN or SNPN, either a new PLMN or SNPN is\nselected automatically, or an indication of which PLMNs or SNPNs are\navailable is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made.  \nRegistration is not performed by MSs only capable of services that need\nno registration.  \nThe purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:  \na\\) It enables the MS to receive system information from the PLMN or\nSNPN.  \nb\\) If the MS wishes to initiate a call, it can do this by initially\naccessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is\ncamped.\n\nInformation 4:\naccessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is\ncamped.  \nc\\) If the PLMN or SNPN receives a call for the MS, it knows (in most\ncases) the registration area of the cell in which the MS is camped. It\ncan then send a \\\"paging\\\" message for the MS on control channels of all\nthe cells in the registration area. The MS will then receive the paging\nmessage because it is tuned to the control channel of a cell in that\nregistration area, and the MS can respond on that control channel.  \nd\\) It enables the MS to receive cell broadcast messages.  \nIf the MS is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, or the SIM is\nnot inserted, or there is no valid entry in \\\"list of subscriber data\\\"\nin case the MS is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP\naccess, or if it receives certain responses to an LR request (e.g.,\n\\\"illegal MS\\\"), it attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of the PLMN\nidentity or the SNPN identity, and enters a \\\"limited service\\\" state in\nwhich it can only attempt to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. An\nMS operating in NB-S1 mode, never attempts to make emergency calls or to\naccess RLOS. An MS operating in N1 mode never attempts to access RLOS.  \nIf the MS is in eCall only mode, it attempts to camp on a suitable cell\nand enters an \\\"eCall inactive\\\" state in which it can only attempt an\neCall over IMS, or a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or\nterminal reconfiguration services as specified in 3GPPTS31.102\\[40\\].  \nIf the MS is in eCall only mode and is unable to find a suitable cell to\ncamp on, it attempts to camp on an acceptable cell in limited service\nstate, and enters an \\\"eCall inactive\\\" state in which it can only\nattempt an eCall over IMS.  \nWhile in eCall inactive state, the MS does not perform LR with the PLMN\nof the cell on which the MS is camped.  \nIn A/Gb mode, if the CTS MS is in CTS mode only or in automatic mode\nwith CTS preferred, it will start by attempting to find a CTS fixed part\n\nInformation 5:\nservice state provides Emergency Services to these UE, regardless\nwhether the UE can be authenticated, has roaming or Mobility\nRestrictions or a valid subscription.  \nFor Emergency Services over 3GPP access via PLMN, other than eCall over\nIMS, the UEs in limited service state that do not operate in SNPN access\nmode determine that the cell supports Emergency Services over NG-RAN\nfrom a broadcast indicator in AS. The cell connected to EPC and 5GC\nbroadcasts separate broadcast indicator for EPC and 5GC to indicate\nsupport of emergency services by the EPC and 5GC. If the UE supports\nSNPN access mode, is in limited service state, is not operating in SNPN\naccess mode, needs to make an emergency call and cannot find an\nacceptable cell in any PLMN, the UE may activate SNPN access mode and\nattempt to camp on an acceptable cell of any available SNPN supporting\nemergency calls (irrespective of SNPN ID or GIN) as defined in\nTS23.122\\[17\\]. For Emergency Services over untrusted non-3GPP access,\nother than eCall over IMS, the UE in limited service state selects any\nN3IWF as specified in clause6.3.6. Emergency calls for eCall Over IMS\nmay only be performed if the UE has a USIM.  \nFor Emergency Services over NR via SNPN, other than eCall over IMS, the\nUEs in limited service state that operate in SNPN access mode determine\nthat the cell supports Emergency Services over NR from a broadcast\nindicator in AS and indication that the SNPN supports Emergency\nServices. If the UE operates in SNPN access mode and is in limited\nservice state, the UE shall attempt to camp on an acceptable cell of any\navailable SNPN supporting emergency calls (irrespective of SNPN ID or\nGIN). If the UE cannot find acceptable cell on any available SNPN, the\nUE shall deactivate SNPN access mode and camp on any available PLMN cell\nsupporting emergency calls (irrespective of PLMN ID) as defined in\nTS23.122\\[17\\].  \nFor NR satellite access, if a UE in limited service state is aware of\n\nQuestion: What happens when a mobile station (MS) attempts to camp on a cell for which it does not have service entitlement?

The NWDAF containing MTLF sends a response.  \n8\\. The NWDAF containing MTLF determines whether the ML model is\ndegraded or not based on the notification at step6. If the notification\ncontains Analytics feedback information, the NWDAF containing MTLF may\ndetermine ML model degradation based on the procedures as described in\nclause6.2E.2. Otherwise when the NWDAF containing MTLF has received the\nmultiple analytics accuracy information, from one or more NWDAFs\ncontaining AnLF, it may consider that the ML model is degraded/to be\nupdated (i.e. enough number analytics accuracy information received from\none or more NWDAFs containing AnLF, indicating insufficient analytics\naccuracy).  \nNOTE2: The actual mechanism for the NWDAF containing MTLF for\ndetermining the degradation of the ML model degradation is an internal\nprocedure of the NWDAF containing MTLF, e.g. the NWDAF containing MTLF\ncalculate a global accuracy based on the analytics accuracy information\nand the number of inferences received from multiple NWDAFs containing\nAnLF.  \n9\\. When an ML model is considered degraded / to be updated at step8,\nthe NWDAF containing MTLF re-trains the existing ML model or selects a\nnew ML model. If the network data was not included in the\nNnwdaf\\_MLModelMonitor\\_Notify request of step5, the NWDAF containing\nMTLF may request data from the NWDAF containing AnLF, ADRF and/or other\n5GS entities as specified in clause6.2 and use the collected data for\n\nInformation 3:\nof that ML model.  \nWhen the NWDAF containing AnLF does no longer monitor the accuracy of\nthe ML model, it sends an Nnwdaf\\_MLModelMontior\\_Unregister service\noperation. The NWDAF containing MTLF deletes the associated data.  \n#### 6.29.2.5 Procedure for the detection of ML model degradation  \nFigure 6.29.2.5-1 illustrates the procedure for the detection of ML\nmodel degradation. A new Nnwdaf\\_MLModelMonitor\\_Subscribe and\nNnwdaf\\_MLModelMonitor\\_Notify service operations are used for that\npurpose. An NWDAF service consumer, i.e. an NWDAF containing MTLF,\nsubscribes at another NWDAF, i.e. an NWDAF containing AnLF, to be\nnotified when the accuracy of the previously provisioned trained MT\nmodel is not sufficient.  \nFigure 6.29.2.5-1: Procedure for ML model degradation detection  \n0\\. An NWDAF containing MTLF receives a trigger for subscribing to the\nML model monitor at an NWDAF containing an AnLF. This trigger could be\nthe reception of an Nnwdaf\\_MLModelMonitor\\_Register request, an\nadministrative action, or determined by local policy. The NWDAF\ncontaining MTLF reads the information registered by the AnLF, such as\nthe NF ID, unique identifier of the ML model, MLModelMonitor\nsubscription endpoint, etc.  \n1\\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends an Nnwdaf\\_MLModelMonitor\\_Subscribe\nrequest (Analytics ID, unique identifier of the ML model to be\nmonitored, optionally Reporting Threshold(s)) to an NWDAF containing\nAnLF subscription endpoint.  \n2\\. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends a response to the NWDAF containing\nMTLF.  \n3\\. NWDAF containing AnLF starts an internal process for monitoring the\naccuracy of the ML model.  \nNOTE: NWDAF containing AnLF can monitor the accuracy in many ways: e.g.\nget ground truth value of the predictions, subscribe to NF events that\nrelated to the analytics ID, or following the instructions embedded in\nthe model from the MTLF, etc.  \n4,5 Upon detection of an insufficient accuracy of the ML model, and if\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.29.2 Procedures  \n#### 6.29.2.1 General  \nThe proposed solution consists of two main parts:  \n\\- How to detect whether an ML model has been degraded.  \n\\- Trigger proper action in case ML model degradation has been observed.  \nEach part is discussed in the following (sub)clauses.  \n#### 6.29.2.2 Detection of ML Model Degradation  \nFigure 6.29.2.2-1 illustrates an NWDAF containing AnLF registering to an\nNWDAF containing MTLF its monitoring capability for the determining the\naccuracy of the ML model. Then, the NWDAF containing MTLF subscribes to\nthe NWDAF containing AnLF for the monitoring of an ML model. If the\naccuracy of an ML model is not sufficient, or if degradation in the ML\nmodel is detected, the NWDAF containing AnLF generates a notification to\nthe NWDAF containing MTLF.  \nIn this solution, the NWDAF containing AnLF may start the accuracy\nmonitoring process when it starts making use of an ML model, and it\nregisters with the MTLF that is responsible for training/updating this\nML model. The NWDAF containing MTLF, due to the registration of accuracy\nmonitoring from NWDAF containing AnLF or due to local policies,\nsubscribes to the NWDAF containing AnLF for receiving notifications of\nthe detection of degradation of the ML Model.  \nWhen the subscription request is received, the NWDAF containing AnLF is\nassumed to be in possession of possible ML model\\'s associated\ninformation, included in the ML model file, that can be used to support\nthe AnLF performing the accuracy monitoring of the ML model. The NWDAF\ncontaining AnLF may start the accuracy monitoring process when it starts\nmaking use of the ML model. NWDAF containing AnLF monitors the accuracy\nof the ML model and notifies NWDAF containing MTLF if any degradation is\ndetected.  \nFigure 6.29.2.2-1: Monitoring an ML model and report degradation if\ndetected  \n#### 6.29.2.3 Act Upon ML Model Degradation  \nIn the case of detecting low accuracy of an ML model which has been\n\nInformation 5:\nmonitor the performance of the ML model.  \n9\\. The AnLF sends the data to the MTLF by reusing the MLModelProvision\nservice (subscription Correlation ID, Analytic ID, input data,\nprediction and its corresponding ground truth data).  \nAlternatively, the AnLF could store the data in the ADRF by using\nNadrf\\_DataManagement\\_StorageRequest, which could be retrieved by MTLF\nto calculate Accuracy/MAE in use.  \n10-11. The MTLF calculates the Accuracy/MAE in Use by comparing\npredictions and the corresponding ground truth data retrieved from the\nAnLF in step 9, and compares the Accuracy/MAE in Use with the\nAccuracy/MAE in Training and decide whether or not to re-train the ML\nmodel.  \n12\\. The MTLF may collect the new data for re-training from data\nproviders, e.g. OAM, NFs.  \n13\\. The MTLF re-trains the ML model with the data collected in step 9\nand step 12, and notifies the AnLF with the re-trained model and\naccuracy report (Accuracy/MAE in Use and/or Accuracy/MAE in\nre-training).  \n14-15.

There shall be\nan authentication procedure between all entities in the 3GPP system\nwhich have a commercial relationship.  \nIn the case of a multimedia telephony, when the HPLMN requests that\noptimal media routeing is not applied, the VPLMN shall disable optimal\nmedia routeing for all the subscribers of the requesting network.  \n7.2 Fraud Control\n-----------------  \nA mechanism to control fraud shall be provided by the serving networks\nand the home environment.\n\nInformation 3:\nhome environments;  \n\\- to enable the Home environment to provide a Prepay Service and to\nenable the serving network to support that Prepay Service for the Home\nenvironment's subscribers;  \n\\- to allow interconnect (inter-operator) charging including\nmobile/fixed operator to mobile/fixed operator (circuit switched & IP),\nand mobile/fixed operator to IP network provider; and mobile/fixed\noperator to I-WLAN operator;  \n\\- to allow Network operator to 3^rd^ party supplier (e.g. Value-Added\nService Provider) charging;  \n\\- to provide details required for Customer Care purposes;  \n\\- to support the shared network architecture so that end users can be\nappropriately charged for their usage of the shared network, and network\nsharing partners can be allocated their share of the costs of the shared\nnetwork resources.  \nThe high-level principles that will guide the charging requirements are\nsummarised as follows:  \n\\- It shall be possible to charge separately for each type of medium\nused (e.g. voice, video, data) in a session and for each service used\n(e.g. voice call, streaming video, file download);  \n\\- It shall be possible to charge for different levels of QoS applied\nfor and/or allocated during a session for each type of medium or service\nused;  \n\\- It shall be possible to charge each \\\"leg\\\" of a session separately.\nThis includes the incoming and outgoing legs and any\nforwarded/redirected legs. (Note: The legs mentioned here are logical\nlegs, i.e. not necessarily identical to actual signal and traffic flow.\nEven though tromboning may be avoided by optimal routing, the operator\nshould still be able to charge for the 'virtual legs' of the call);  \n\\- It shall be possible to charge unsuccessful calls and sessions (e.g.\nfor billing purposes, to provide the user a full documentation of his\ncall attempts);  \n\\- The user can be charged according to the service used irrespective of\nthe technology used to deliver it. (That is, the charge is not derived\n\nInformation 4:\npurposes becomes possible.  \nThese new requirements and principles will allow users more freedom to\nobtain service when roaming, whilst providing effective cost and credit\ncontrol for the Home Environment and User.  \n4.1 Cross Phase Compatibility\n-----------------------------  \nWhere possible (e.g. services already defined within earlier releases),\nthe charging information collected shall be consistent with the\ninformation already provided  \nIt is envisaged that 3GPP system will evolve beyond this Release with\nthe addition of a number of new requirements for charging and billing,\nfor example with the addition of a number of new requirements for\ncharging and billing; these are noted in the appropriate sections below.\nThe technical standards for each release should be developed in such a\nway that it is possible and practical to introduce these requirements,\nideally in a backward compatible manner.  \nNote: When a change is introduced which affects the 3GPP technical\nstandards, it is said to be \\'backward compatible\\' if existing\nequipment can continue to operate and perform correctly with equipment\nthat conforms to the new implementation.  \n4.2 Charging Entity Relationships\n---------------------------------  \nIn the process of introduction of the all-IP technology there will be a\nmixture of different types of entities using different types of\ntechnology.  \nThe diagram below shows the different entities involved in charging and\ntheir relationships.  \nThe types of entities and the relevant type of charging as shown on the\ndiagram are as follows:  \n-   **Users:** retail charged by Mobile Network Operator or 3^rd^ Party\nService Provider.  \n-   **3^rd^ Party Service Providers:** wholesale charged by Mobile\nNetwork Operator.  \n-   **Other telecommunications operators:** interconnect charging\nbetween Mobile Network Operator and non-IP \\\"circuit-switched\\\"\nNetwork Operators for call traffic carried; usage charging between\n\nInformation 5:\nobtain service when roaming, whilst providing effective cost and credit\ncontrol for the Home Environment and User.  \n4.1 Cross Phase Compatibility\n-----------------------------  \nWhere possible (e.g. services already defined within earlier releases),\nthe charging information collected shall be consistent with the\ninformation already provided  \nIt is envisaged that 3GPP system will evolve beyond this Release with\nthe addition of a number of new requirements for charging and billing,\nfor example with the addition of a number of new requirements for\ncharging and billing; these are noted in the appropriate sections below.\nThe technical standards for each release should be developed in such a\nway that it is possible and practical to introduce these requirements,\nideally in a backward compatible manner.  \nNote: When a change is introduced which affects the 3GPP technical\nstandards, it is said to be \\'backward compatible\\' if existing\nequipment can continue to operate and perform correctly with equipment\nthat conforms to the new implementation.  \n4.2 Charging Entity Relationships\n---------------------------------  \nIn the process of introduction of the all-IP technology there will be a\nmixture of different types of entities using different types of\ntechnology.  \nThe diagram below shows the different entities involved in charging and\ntheir relationships.  \nThe types of entities and the relevant type of charging as shown on the\ndiagram are as follows:  \n-   **Users:** retail charged by Mobile Network Operator or 3^rd^ Party\nService Provider.  \n-   **3^rd^ Party Service Providers:** wholesale charged by Mobile\nNetwork Operator.  \n-   **Other telecommunications operators:** interconnect charging\nbetween Mobile Network Operator and non-IP \\\"circuit-switched\\\"\nNetwork Operators for call traffic carried; usage charging between\nMobile Network Operator and IP-based Network Operators for session\ntraffic carried.\n\nQuestion: What is the role of the home environment in the delegation of charging authority?

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nFlows) and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate\n(non-GBR QoS Flows). At NAS level (see TS 23.501 \\[3\\]), the QoS flow is\nthus the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in a PDU session. A\nQoS flow is identified within a PDU session by a QoS Flow ID (QFI)\ncarried in an encapsulation header over NG-U.  \nThe **QoS architecture** in NG-RAN, both for NR connected to 5GC and for\nE-UTRA connected to 5GC, is depicted in the Figure 12-1 and described in\nthe following:  \n\\- For each UE, 5GC establishes one or more PDU Sessions;  \n\\- Except for NB-IoT and IAB-MT in SA mode, for each UE, the NG-RAN\nestablishes at least one Data Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU\nSession and additional DRB(s) for QoS flow(s) of that PDU session can be\nsubsequently configured (it is up to NG-RAN when to do so);  \n\\- If NB-IoT UE supports NG-U data transfer, the NG-RAN may establish\nData Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU Session and one PDU\nsession maps to only one DRB;  \n\\- The NG-RAN maps packets belonging to different PDU sessions to\ndifferent DRBs;  \n\\- NAS level packet filters in the UE and in the 5GC associate UL and DL\npackets with QoS Flows;  \n\\- AS-level mapping rules in the UE and in the NG-RAN associate UL and\nDL QoS Flows with DRBs.  \nFigure 12-1: QoS architecture  \nNG-RAN and 5GC ensure quality of service (e.g. reliability and target\ndelay) by mapping packets to appropriate QoS Flows and DRBs. Hence there\nis a 2-step mapping of IP-flows to QoS flows (NAS) and from QoS flows to\nDRBs (Access Stratum).  \nAt **NAS level**, a QoS flow is characterised by a QoS profile provided\nby 5GC to NG-RAN and QoS rule(s) provided by 5GC to the UE. The QoS\nprofile is used by NG-RAN to determine the treatment on the radio\ninterface while the QoS rules dictates the mapping between uplink User\nPlane traffic and QoS flows to the UE. A QoS flow may either be GBR or\nNon-GBR depending on its profile. The QoS profile of a QoS flow contains\n\nInformation 2:\nprofile (as described in clause5.7.3).  \n#### 5.7.1.2a Alternative QoS Profile  \nThe Alternative QoS Profile(s) can be optionally provided for a GBR QoS\nFlow with Notification control enabled.

The SMF sends the QoS profiles to the NG-RAN and the QoS Profile\nTiming Map. If the Traffic Pattern Information is received, the NG-RAN\nformulates QoS Profile Timing Map.  \n4\\. The NG-RAN alternates between the different QoS Profiles provided by\nthe SMF according to the QoS Profile Timing Map. The QoS Profile Timing\nMap may, for example, specify alternating QoS between:  \n\\- QoS 1: Time 2:30:30 to 2:30:35 (five seconds).  \n\\- QoS 2: Time 3:30:00 to 3:40:00 (10 minutes).  \nWhere QoS 1 provides resources for model transfer while QoS 2 provides\nresources for low bandwidth background traffic (i.e. when no model\ntransfer occurs).  \nWhen the requested QoS cannot be provided in the specific time slot, the\nAF is notified that QoS targets can no longer be fulfilled, as per\nTS23.503\\[5\\] clause6.1.3.18.  \nThe existing procedures for resources reservation and QoS fulfilment\napply, i.e. there is no additional mechanism proposed by this solution\nin this respect. Approach in NG-RAN is similar to alternative QoS\nhandling.  \nThe solution allows switching between different QoS profiles at NG-RAN,\nthus avoiding signalling at each QoS change, between PCF and SMF, and\nbetween SMF and NG-RAN.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the QoS profile in NG-RAN?

For example, during the\nfeasibility study, in order to assure the performance, the 3GPP\nmanagement system should be able to determine the network availability\nfor that service. This could be done by informing the MDAS provider\nabout the network requirements and check if the requirements can be met\nwith the available network resources.  \nMDAS provider may already have network requirement for a given service\nrequirement, which is obtained by the historical analysis using offline\nor online monitoring of network resource usage of similar services. The\n3GPP management system may check the feasibility of provisioning the\ncommunication services by using the existing network, and if feasible,\nprovision the communication services using that network to go to the\noperational phase If the network requirement cannot be determined (e.g.\nnot sufficient prior data), the 3GPP management system may assign\ncertain amount of the initial network resources and limit the number of\nusers admitted by configuring the appropriate CN functions. The resource\nusage information and the services using those resources in a given time\nperiod with their performance (e.g. delay) is monitored by the 3GPP\nmanagement system for different number of UEs to learn the network\nresource requirement for different service requirements. This data could\nbe used to determine network requirements for future service requests\nduring the provisioning phase or to adjust network resources to reflect\nthe changing service demands for the already admitted communication\nservices.  \nIt may be a continuous learning process in the run-time phase since\nservice degradation could happen due to various reasons and network\n\nInformation 2:\n\\- to provide an efficient means of using network resources\n(particularly radio spectrum).  \n4.2 Standardisation of Service Capabilities\n-------------------------------------------  \nExisting systems have traditionally standardised the complete sets of\nteleservices, applications and supplementary services which they\nprovide.

The Service Provider may also update or revoke the user\nconsent.  \n2). AF authorisation - The NEF checks whether the AF is authorized for\nuser consent provision or update.  \n3). The NEF may inquire with the UDM to translate UE ext\\_Id to a 3GPP\ninternal identity UE\\_Id. Then the NEF forwards the request from the AF\nto the UDM via Nudm\\_ParameterProvision\\_Update Request (UE\\_Id, user\nconsent for UE data collection).  \n4). The user consent for UE data collection parameter is stored in the\nUDM as a subscription information.

This identifier,\ncalled UE ID (could be the GPSI or the EEL-generated Edge UE ID, defined\nin clause 7.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.558 \\[11\\]), is used by the EAS to invoke\ncapability APIs specific to UEs over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending on\nthe UE ID type.  \nThe EES uses user information (e.g. IP address) received in the UE\nIdentifier API invocation and obtains the UE identifier by interacting\nwith NEF as specified in clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \\[9\\]. The EES\nmay utilize the Nnef\\_UEId\\_Get service (clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS\n23.502 \\[9\\]) providing the user information provided by the EEC,\ni.e.private UE IP address.  \nSince the user information (i.e. private UE IP address) may be used to\ndetermine the UE ID, it is needed to ensure that the user information is\ntrusted, and the EEC is authorized to use this user information as a\nparameter in the API invocation.  \nThis key issue is to study the security and privacy aspects of usage of\nuser information provided by the EEC in the UE ID API invocation.  \n#### 5.3.7.2 Threats  \nIf user information (i.e. the private UE IP address) provided by the EEC\nis not verified and the EEC is not authorized to use this information, a\nmalicious or compromised EEC or a malicious API consumer can try to\nexecute IP address spoofing attacks to learn identifiers of other UEs,\nincluding those they are not authorized to access. In this case, the EAS\nobtains an incorrect UE identifier, when the EAS use this incorrect UE\nidentifier to invoke capability APIs specific to UE over EDGE-7,\nunauthorized information (e.g. UE location) belonging to another UE is\nexposed to the EAS.  \n#### 5.3.7.3 Potential security requirements\n\nInformation 4:\nthe list of allowed Analytics/Network Exposure events that the UE may\nrequest from the UDM by providing the AIML operation type and\ncorrelation ID, or the SMF may send this information to the NDWAF and\nthe NWDAF can get the relevant Analytics from the UDM.

The RRC layer may reconfigure\nradio resources during an established RRC connection. This function\nincludes coordination of the radio resource allocation between multiple\nradio bearers related to the same RRC connection.

For an RLC\nentity configured at the gNB, there is a peer RLC entity configured at\nthe UE and vice versa. In NR sidelink communication, in NR sidelink\ndiscovery, for an RLC entity configured at the transmitting UE, there is\na peer RLC entity configured at each receiving UE.  \nAn RLC entity receives/delivers RLC SDUs from/to upper layer and\nsends/receives RLC PDUs to/from its peer RLC entity via lower layers.  \nAn RLC PDU can either be an RLC data PDU or an RLC control PDU. If an\nRLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer, it receives them through\na single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer, and after forming RLC\ndata PDUs from the received RLC SDUs, the RLC entity submits the RLC\ndata PDUs to lower layer through a single logical channel. If an RLC\nentity receives RLC data PDUs from lower layer, it receives them through\na single logical channel, and after forming RLC SDUs from the received\nRLC data PDUs, the RLC entity delivers the RLC SDUs to upper layer\nthrough a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer.

        "question": "How do victim gNBs determine if the atmospheric ducting phenomenon has ceased in the wireless framework? [3GPP Release 18]",
        "answer": "option 5: By not receiving any reference signal sent from aggressors",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nat most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each\ngNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.  \nTo mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks for\ncoordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination\ncommunication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The\nbackhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul\ncommunication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is\npurely wireless.  \nIn both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set simultaneously transmit an\nidentical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.  \nIn the wireless framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal\nfrom the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and send\nback a RIM reference signal carrying the aggressor set ID. The RIM\nreference signal sent by the aggressor is able to provide information\nwhether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon exists. The victim gNBs\nrealize the atmospheric ducting phenomenon have ceased upon not\nreceiving any reference signal sent from aggressors.  \nIn the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference\nsignal from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and\nestablish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul\nmessages are sent from individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim\ngNB, where the signalling is transparent to the core network. The RIM\nbackhaul messages from aggressor to victim gNBs carry the indication\nabout the detection or disappearance of RIM reference signal. Based on\nthe indication from the backhaul message, the victim gNBs realize\nwhether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote interference\nhave ceased.  \nIn both frameworks, upon realizing that the atmospheric ducting has\ndisappeared, the victim gNBs stop transmitting the RIM reference signal.  \n17.2 Cross-Link Interference Management\n---------------------------------------\n\nInformation 2:\n### 16.14.8 Coarse UE location reporting  \nUpon network request, after AS security is established in connected\nmode, a UE should report its coarse UE location information (most\nsignificant bits of the GNSS coordinates, ensuring an accuracy in the\norder of 2 km) to the NG-RAN if available.  \n17 Interference Management\n==========================  \n17.1 Remote Interference Management\n-----------------------------------  \nThe atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at higher\naltitudes in the Earth\\'s atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive index,\ncausing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal trapped in\nthe atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD\nnetworks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of\natmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference\nbetween UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the\natmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a\nrelatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard\nperiod. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere\nwith the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the\naggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The\nfurther the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the\nvictim will be impacted.  \nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and\naggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management\n(RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and\nvictim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is\nassigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal\n(RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each\naggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim\ngNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have\nat most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each\n\nInformation 3:\n### 8.2.7 gNB-DU Status Indication  \n#### 8.2.7.1 General  \nThe purpose of the gNB-DU Status Indication procedure is informing the\ngNB-CU that the gNB-DU is overloaded so that overload reduction actions\ncan be applied. This procedure is also used to inform the IAB-donor-CU\nabout a downlink congestion at an IAB-DU or an IAB-donor-DU. The\nprocedure uses non-UE associated signalling.  \n#### 8.2.7.2 Successful Operation  \nFigure 8.2.7.2-1: gNB-DU Status Indication procedure  \nIf the *gNB-DU* *Overload Information* IE in the GNB-DU STATUS\nINDICATION message indicates that the gNB-DU is overloaded, the gNB-CU\nshall apply overload reduction actions until informed, with a new GNB-DU\nSTATUS INDICATION message, that the overload situation has ceased.  \nThe detailed overload reduction policy is up to gNB-CU implementation.  \nIf the gNB-DU is an IAB-DU or an IAB-donor-DU, and if the *IAB\nCongestion Indication* IE is present in the GNB-DU STATUS INDICATION\nmessage and only includes the *Child Node Identifier* IE, the gNB-CU\nshall, if supported, consider that the backhaul link between the gNB-DU\nand the node identified by the *Child Node Identifier* IE is congested.\nIf the *IAB Congestion Indication* IE is present in the GNB-DU STATUS\nINDICATION message and includes both the *Child Node Identifier* IE and\nthe *BH RLC CH ID* IE, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, consider that\ncongestion occurs on the corresponding BH RLC channel(s) over the link\ntowards the node identified by the *Child Node Identifier* IE.  \n#### 8.2.7.3 Abnormal Conditions  \nVoid.\n\nInformation 4:\nIf a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period\nT~identify\\_intra\\_eICIC~ defined above becomes undetectable for a\nperiod \u2264 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and\ntriggers an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall\nbe less than T~Measurement\\_Period\\_eICIC,\\ Intra~ provided the timing\nto that cell has not changed more than \u00b150 Ts and the L3 filter has not\nbeen used.

It means the 5G VN\ngroup parameters about a UE may be configured in subscription data of\nthe UE and delivered together with other subscription data by the UDM\nfor supporting 5G LAN service. For the configuration for 5G VN group\ndata management, the 3GPP management system can support the 5G VN group\ndata management, including:  \n\\- The configuration for 5G VN group data creation based on External\nGroup ID.  \n\\- The configuration for 5G VN group data modification based on External\nGroup ID.  \n\\- The configuration for 5G VN group data deletion based on External\nGroup ID.\n\nInformation 3:\nThe PCF manages the Maximum Group Data Rate based on the 5G VN group\ndata, as described in clauses 6.1.5 and 6.2.1.11 of TS23.503\\[45\\].  \nAn AF may update the UE Identities of the 5G VN group at any time after\nthe initial provisioning.  \nAn AF may subscribe to notification of the group status changes for the\n5G VN group as described in clause5.20.  \nThe PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5G VN group data\ncannot be modified after the initial provisioning.  \nIn this Release of the specification, the home network of the 5G VN\ngroup members is same.  \nIn this Release of the specification, only a 1:1 mapping between (DNN,\nS-NSSAI) combination and 5G VN group is supported.  \nThe PCF delivers 5G VN group configuration information (DNN, S-NSSAI,\nPDU session type) to the UE for each GPSI that belongs to a 5G VN group.\nThe 5G VN group configuration information is delivered in the URSP from\nthe PCF to the UE using the UE Configuration Update procedure for\ntransparent UE Policy delivery as described in clause4.2.4.3 of\nTS23.502\\[3\\] and clause6.1.2.2 of TS23.503\\[45\\].\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.13.3 Group Provisioning Procedure  \nFigure 6.13.3-1 provides the details of the procedures:  \nFigure 6.13.3-1: AF Creating and Provisioning Group ID profiles to 5GC  \n1\\. AF assigns an (external) Group ID and includes a list of UEs to the\ngroup. AF then sends Nnef\\_ParameterProvision\\_Create/Update/Delete\nrequest including the Group info (Group Members, Service area and QoS\nparameters for the group, \\[5G-VN group\\]).  \n5G VN group indicates if to the group is a \\\"5G VN group\\\". This will\nindicate to 5GC that the group is associated with 5G VN communication\nmechanisms as defined in clauses 5.29.3 and 5.29.4 of TS23.501\\[2\\].  \n2\\. NEF after authorizing the AF request, translates the external\ninformation to 5GC internal information e.g. external group ID into an\ninternal group ID. The NEF sends\nNudm\\_ParameterProvision\\_Create/Update/Delete request (Group ID, Group\nmembers, Service area/TAIs, attribute).  \n3-4. UDM uses Nudr\\_DM\\_Query/Update messages. UDR stores the data as\npart of the Group subscription data and responds with\nNudr\\_DM\\_Create/Update/Delete Response message.  \n5-6. AF receives the Response message to its request in step1.  \n7\\. Consumer Network Function e.g. AMF and SMF may subscribe and thus\nget notified on the group subscription information. In case of NF\nenforced functionality (e.g. Service area related restriction) the\nsubscribing to the notification is mandatory. If the group information\nis to be provided to AMF and/or to SMF following mechanism is envisaged:  \n\\- NFs (e.g. AMF, SMF) subscribe to UDM for the subscription data\nchanges (creation / modification / deletion) of the group member UEs.\nWhen such groups are subject to a creation / modification / deletion,\nthe UDM notifies the subscribed NF with Nudm\\_SDM\\_Notification (SUPI,\nInternal Group Identifier, \\[5G VN group\\], etc.) service operation.  \n\\- UDM may also indicate shared data identifier to Group Subscription\ndata, as mentioned in clause4.15.6.2 of TS23.502\\[3\\] and explained\n\nInformation 5:\nTS29.505\\[145\\]. The PCF receives from the AMF at the UE Policy\nassociation establishment the Internal Group ID(s) corresponding to a\nUE, so that PCF identifies the 5G VN group data that needs to be used to\ngenerate URSP rules to the UE. If the PCF is made aware of a change of\nUE Internal Group Identifier(s) as defined in TS29.525\\[144\\] or\nchange of 5G VN group membership as defined in TS29.505\\[145\\], or\nboth, the PCF then may update the URSP rules for the impacted 5G VN\ngroup members.  \nNOTE4: The proper way to obtain the 5G VN group membership changes of a\nspecific UE, e.g. if the UE is added to a new 5G VN group, is via the\nnotification of change of UE Internal Group Identifier(s) from the AMF\nas specified in TS29.525\\[144\\]. The subscription in the UDR is for\nbeing notified about changes in the 5G VN group data and in the 5G VN\ngroup membership of a specific 5G VN group.  \nAn AF may update the UE Identities of the 5G VN group at any time after\nthe initial provisioning.  \nThe PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5G VN group data\ncannot be modified after the initial provisioning.  \nIn this Release of the specification, the home network of the 5G VN\ngroup members is same.  \nIn this Release of the specification, only a 1:1 mapping between (DNN,\nS-NSSAI) combination and 5G VN group is supported.  \nThe PCF delivers 5G VN group configuration information (DNN, S-NSSAI,\nPDU session type) to the UE for each GPSI that belongs to a 5G VN group.\nThe 5G VN group configuration information is delivered in the URSP from\nthe PCF to the UE using the UE Configuration Update procedure for\ntransparent UE Policy delivery as described in clause4.2.4.3 of\nTS23.502\\[3\\] and clause6.1.2.2 of TS23.503\\[45\\].\n\nQuestion: How is the 5G VN group configuration information delivered to the UE? [3GPP Release 18]\nOptions:\noption 1: Via the NEF using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation\noption 2: Via the UDM using the SM subscription data\noption 3: Via the PCF using the URSP in the UE Configuration Update procedure\noption 4: Via the SMF using the AF request and the PCF policies\noption 5: Via the AMF using the SM subscription data and the Internal Group ID(s)\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 3: Via the PCF using the URSP in the UE Configuration Update procedure\n"

The procedure uses UE-associated\nsignalling.  \n#### 8.12.1.2 Successful Operation  \nFigure 8.12.1.2-1: Location reporting control  \nThe AMF initiates the procedure by sending a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL\nmessage to the NG-RAN node. On receipt of the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL\nmessage the NG-RAN node shall perform the requested location reporting\ncontrol action for the UE.  \nThe *Location Reporting Request Type* IE indicates to the NG-RAN node\nwhether:  \n\\- to report directly;  \n\\- to report upon change of serving cell;  \n\\- to report UE presence in the area of interest;  \n\\- to stop reporting at change of serving cell;  \n\\- to stop reporting UE presence in the area of interest;  \n\\- to cancel location reporting for the UE.  \nIf the *Area Of Interest List* IE is included in the *Location Reporting\nRequest Type* IE in the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message, the NG-RAN\nnode shall store this information and use it to track the UE\\'s presence\nin the area of interest as defined in TS 23.502 \\[10\\].  \nNOTE: The NG-RAN reports the UE presence for all set of Location\nReporting Reference IDs for inter-NG-RAN node handover.  \nIf the *Additional Location Information* IE is included in the LOCATION\nREPORTING CONTROL message and set to \\\"Include PSCell\" then, if Dual\nConnectivity is activated, the NG-RAN node shall include the current\nPSCell in the report. If a report upon change of serving cell is\nrequested, the NG-RAN node shall provide the report also whenever the UE\nchanges the PSCell, and when Dual Connectivity is activated.\n\nInformation 2:\nthe UE is in RRC\\_CONNECTED state, or, when the UE is in RRC\\_INACTIVE\nstate, the UE\\'s last known location (including the PSCell ID if PSCell\nreporting is requested and the UE was using Dual Connectivity\nimmediately before entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC\\_INACTIVE state) with\ntime stamp if the NG-RAN perceives that the UE presence in the Area Of\nInterest is different from the last one reported. When the NG-RAN\ndetects that the UE has moved out of or into multiple areas of interest,\nit sends multiple pairs of UE Presence in the Area Of Interest and the\nRequest Reference ID in one Location Report message to AMF.

The NG-RAN location reporting may be\nused by the AMF when the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. The NG-RAN\nlocation reporting may be used by the AMF to determine the\ngeographically located TAI in the case of NR satellite access.  \nThe AMF may request the NG-RAN location reporting with event reporting\ntype (e.g. UE location or UE presence in Area of Interest), reporting\nmode and its related parameters (e.g. number of reporting).  \nIf the AMF requests UE location, the NG-RAN reports the current UE\nlocation (or last known UE location with time stamp if the UE is in RRC\nInactive state) based on the requested reporting parameter (e.g.\none-time reporting or continuous reporting).  \nIf the AMF requests UE location, in the case of NR satellite access, the\nNG-RAN provides all broadcast TAIs to the AMF as part of the ULI. The\nNG-RAN also reports the TAI where the UE is geographically located if\nthis TAI can be determined.  \nIf the AMF requests UE presence in the Area Of Interest, the NG-RAN\nreports the UE location and the indication (i.e. IN, OUT or UNKNOWN)\nwhen the NG-RAN determines the change of UE presence in Area Of\nInterest.  \nAfter N2 based Handover, if the NG-RAN location reporting information is\nrequired, the AMF shall re-request the NG-RAN location reporting to the\ntarget NG-RAN node. For Xn based Handover, the source NG-RAN shall\ntransfer the requested NG-RAN location reporting information to target\nNG-RAN node.  \nThe AMF requests the location information of the UE either through\nindependent N2 procedure (i.e. NG-RAN location reporting as specified in\nclause4.10 of TS23.502\\[3\\]), or by including the request in some\nspecific N2 messages as specified in TS38.413\\[34\\].\n\nInformation 5:\nthe UE is in RRC Connected state, or, when the UE is in RRC Inactive\nstate, the UE\\'s last known location (including the PSCell ID if PSCell\nreporting is requested and the UE was using Dual Connectivity\nimmediately before entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state) with\ntime stamp if the NG-RAN perceives that the UE presence in the Area Of\nInterest is different from the last one reported. When the NG-RAN\ndetects that the UE has moved out of or into multiple areas of interest,\nit sends multiple pairs of UE Presence in the Area Of Interest and the\nRequest Reference ID in one Location Report message to AMF. If UE\ntransitions from RRC Inactive state to RRC Connected state, NG-RAN shall\ncheck the latest location (including the PSCell ID if PSCell reporting\nis requested and Dual Connectivity is activated) of UE and follow the\nrules when UE is in RRC Connected.  \nThe AMF may receive Location Report even if the UE presence in Area Of\nInterest is not changed.

The scenarios address different service\nareas: urban and rural areas, office and home, and special deployments\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.44.1 Overview  \nIn the roaming ecosystem, a roaming services provider provides the\ntechnical and commercial means to facilitate the deployment and\noperation of roaming services between a client operator and a set of\nselected connected operators.  \nThe roaming services provider handles the technical implementation of\nthe roaming relations in a scalable and operationally efficient way.  \nWith a roaming services provider present in the roaming ecosystem,\noperators can choose not to establish a bilateral direct agreement with\nspecific operators. A trusted relation exists between the involved\noperator and the roaming services provider.  \nRoaming services providers, according to their role and\nresponsibilities, assume financial and technical liability to apply all\nnecessary controls and access to all communications.  \nAmong other functionalities, a roaming services provider needs to:  \n\u2022 Process identifiers and potentially other information transmitted in\nsignalling messages between PLMNs in a secure manner.  \n\u2022 Be able to modify, add or delete information that is relevant to their\nrole, respecting what is contractually agreed in service level\nagreements (SLAs) and enforced technically.  \n\u2022 Isolate the individual operator signalling flows from each other  \n\u2022 Report on the detection of and mitigation of security breaches.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 5.10.1 Introduction  \nStandardized N32 security mechanisms protect the communication between\ntwo SEPPs in two PLMNs if the SEPPS are either directly communicating\nwith each other or communicating via IPX providers. The concept of\nroaming hub is traditionally a topic tackled by GSMA, having not been\naddressed by 3GPP so far.  \nA roaming hub is an entity that has commercial roaming agreements with\nmany PLMNs. It sells access to these roaming agreements to interested\nhome network operators, taking over the correct routing between PLMNs\ncontracting the roaming hub, possibly also via interconnections, i.e.,\nIPX providers. A roaming hub provides contracting network operators fast\nwide access to other network operators without the need for each network\noperator to establish a direct business relationship with the other\nnetwork operators.  \nThis key issue investigates whether existing concepts for N32 security\nare sufficient and whether there is an additional need to specify N32\nsecurity for roaming hub scenarios.\n\nQuestion: What is the key characteristic of a roaming broker enabled Home Environment?

From the perspective of the TSN DN, the 5GS is modelled as\na Layer 2 Ethernet Bridge of the TSN DN.  \nIn addition to supporting interoperation with TSN, 5GS also supports\nTime Sensitive Communication, Time Synchronization and integration with\nDeterministic Networking.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 5.4.1 Description  \nFully distributed TSN model is defined in IEEE802.1Qcc\\[7\\]. Unlike\nthe fully centralized model supported in Rel-16, there is neither a\nCentralized Network Configuration (CNC) entity nor an entity that has\nthe knowledge of the entire TSN network in fully distributed TSN model.\nThe configuration information for stream resource registration is\npropagated along the paths from the Talker to Listeners. The 5G CP (i.e.\nPCF) cannot get the TSN stream requirements and configuration\ninformation from a TSN entity in control plane.  \nIn order to support integration of 5GS with the TSN network deployed in\nfully distributed model, the 5GS should be able to read the\nconfiguration information carried in the TSN stream resource\nregistration messages (e.g. MSRP messages) and modify the messages as a\nTSN bridge based on the 5GS capability. The 5G CN CP should also be able\nto retrieve the TSN stream requirements from the messages transmitted in\nuser plane. Therefore, the enhancements needs to be studied for 5GS to\nsupport fully distributed TSN model:  \n\\- Which IEEE protocols need to be supported?  \n\\- How the 5GS retrieves the TSN stream requirements?  \n\\- How to enforce the TSN stream requirements using 3GPP QoS parameters?  \n\\- Which entity, (e.g. the UE/DS-TT, UPF/NW-TT, SMF or PCF), is\nresponsible for read/modify the TSN stream resource registration\nmessages, and how the 5GS modifies the TSN stream resource registration\nmessage based on 5GS Bridge capability and the configuration information\ncarried in the message?  \nNOTE: This key issue is not addressed within Rel-17 timeframe.  \n5.5 Key issue \\#5: Use of Survival Time for Deterministic Applications in 5GS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInformation 3:\n-----------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in\n3GPP TR21.905\\[1\\] and the following apply.

        "question": "What is the SNR target for higher CBWs assuming 16 and 20 dB? [3GPP Release 18]",
        "answer": "option 3: 16 dB",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nMinimum FR2-1 DL radiated performance requirements are specified for up\nto Rank 2. The required SNR point is 14.4 and 18.6 dB for 16QAM and\n64QAM respectively for 100 MHz and 120 kHz CBW/SCS combination. It can\nbe approximately expected that SNR will not dramatically change for\nhigher CBWs as 400MHz. Same time, some margin on phase noise impact at\nhigher carrier frequency should be considered. For instance, 16 and 20\ndB SNRs can be assumed. Such SNR targets require adjustments of TE\nparameters. Table 7.2.3-4 summarizes required wanted signal + headroom\nbudget to reach 16 and 20 dB DL SNR. The parameters from Table 7.2.3-1\nare assumed with RAN4 assumption on backoff from P1dB.  \nTable 7.2.3-4: Wanted signal + headroom budget vs max achievable DL SNR  \nTarget DL SNR, dB                      16     20\n-------------------------------------- ------ ------\nwanted signal + headroom, dBm/ Ch BW   35.8   39.8  \nWanted signal + headroom budget can be increased by adjustment of power\namplifier 1dB compression point and/or probe antenna gain. Another\noption how to allow testing of high CBW is to restrict max PRB\nallocation size within the CBW. As seen from Table 7.2.3-2, 66 PRB\nallocation size (100 MHz) leads to 7.7 dB max SNR increase compared to\n264PRBs in 400 MHz.  \n8 Test time reduction\n=====================  \n8.1 General\n-----------  \nThe verification methodologies for FR2 UE RF, UE RRM, and UE\ndemodulation requirements are all OTA measurements.

An AMF\nsupports the AMF selection functionality to select an AMF for relocation\nor because the initially selected AMF was not an appropriate AMF to\nserve the UE (e.g. due to change of Allowed NSSAI). Other CP NF(s), e.g.\nSMF, supports the AMF selection functionality to select an AMF from the\nAMF set when the original AMF serving a UE is unavailable.  \n5G-AN selects an AMF Set and an AMF from the AMF Set under the following\ncircumstances:  \n1\\) When the UE provides no 5G-S-TMSI nor the GUAMI to the 5G-AN.  \n2\\) When the UE provides 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI but the routing information\n(i.e. AMF identified based on AMF Set ID, AMF pointer) present in the\n5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI is not sufficient and/or not usable (e.g. UE provides\nGUAMI with an AMF region ID from a different region).  \n3\\) AMF has instructed AN that the AMF (identified by GUAMI(s)) is\nunavailable and no target AMF is identified and/or AN has detected that\nthe AMF has failed.  \n4\\) When the UE attempts to establish a signalling connection, and the\nfollowing conditions are met:  \n\\- the 5G-AN knows in what country the UE is located; and  \n\\- the 5G-AN is connected to AMFs serving different PLMNs of different\ncountries; and  \n\\- the UE provides a 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI, which indicates an AMF serving\na different country to where the UE is currently located; and  \n\\- the 5G-AN is configured to enforce selection of the AMF based on the\ncountry the UE is currently located.  \nThen the 5G-AN shall select an AMF serving a PLMN corresponding to the\nUE\\'s current location. How 5G-AN selects the AMF in this case is\ndefined in TS38.410\\[125\\].  \nNOTE: AMF selection case 4) does not apply if 5G-AN nodes serves one\ncountry only.\n\nInformation 4:\nThen the 5G-AN shall select an AMF serving a PLMN corresponding to the\nUE\\'s current location. How 5G-AN selects the AMF in this case is\ndefined in TS38.410\\[125\\].  \nNOTE: AMF selection case 4) does not apply if 5G-AN nodes serves one\ncountry only.  \nIn the case of NF Service Consumer based discovery and selection, the CP\nNF selects an AMF from the AMF Set under the following circumstances:  \n\\- When the AMF has instructed CP NF that a certain AMF identified by\nGUAMI(s) is unavailable and the CP NF was not notified of target AMF;\nand/or  \n\\- CP NF has detected that the AMF has failed; and/or  \n\\- When the selected AMF does not support the UE\\'s Preferred Network\nBehaviour; and/or  \n\\- When the selected AMF does not support the High Latency communication\nfor NR RedCap UE.  \nIn the case of delegated discovery and associated selection, the SCP\nselects an AMF from the corresponding AMF Set under the following\ncircumstances:  \n\\- The SCP gets an indication \\\"select new AMF within SET\\\" from the CP\nNF; and/or  \n\\- SCP has detected that the AMF has failed.  \nThe AMF selection functionality in the 5G-AN may consider the following\nfactors for selecting the AMF Set:  \n\\- AMF Region ID and AMF Set ID derived from GUAMI;  \n\\- Requested NSSAI;  \n\\- Local operator policies;  \n\\- 5G CIoT features indicated in RRC signalling by the UE;  \n\\- IAB-indication;  \n\\- NB-IoT RAT Type;  \n\\- Category M Indication;  \n\\- NR RedCap Indication;  \n\\- SNPN Onboarding indication as indicated in RRC signalling by the UE.  \nAMF selection functionality in the 5G-AN or CP NFs or SCP considers the\nfollowing factors for selecting an AMF from AMF Set:  \n\\- Availability of candidate AMF(s).  \n\\- Load balancing across candidate AMF(s) (e.g. considering weight\nfactors of candidate AMFs in the AMF Set).  \n\\- In 5G-AN, 5G CIoT features indicated in RRC signalling by the UE.  \n\\- In 5G-AN, SNPN Onboarding indication as indicated in RRC signalling\nby the UE.\n\nInformation 5:\nUE association with a new AMF UE NGAP ID towards the 5G-AN and replace\nthe GUAMI in the UE context stored at the 5G-AN with the new GUAMI\nassociated with the newly selected AMF if the 5G-GUTI has been updated.\nThe AMF also informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value\n(derived from the new 5G-GUTI).  \n\\- Target AMF shall not use old GUAMI to allocate 5G-GUTI for UE(s) that\nare being served by Target AMF.  \n#### 5.21.2.3 Procedure for AMF Auto-recovery  \nIn order to try and handle AMF failure in a graceful manner (i.e.\nwithout impacting the UE), AMF can either back up the UE contexts in\nUDSF, or per GUAMI granularity in other AMFs (serving as backup AMF for\nthe indicated GUAMI).  \nNOTE1: Frequency of backup is left to implementation.  \nFor deployments without UDSF, for each GUAMI the backup AMF information\n(in association to the GUAMI) is configured in the AMF. The AMF sends\nthis information to 5G-AN and other CP NFs during the N2 setup procedure\nor the first (per NF) interaction with other CP NFs.  \nIn the case that an AMF fails and the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs detect that the\nAMF has failed, or the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs receives notification from\nanother AMF in the same AMF set that this AMF has failed, following\nactions are taken:  \n\\- The OAM deregister the AMF from NRF indicating due to AMF failure.  \n\\- 5G-AN marks this AMF as failed and not consider the AMF for selection\nuntil explicitly notified.  \n\\- For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers failure detection or\nfailure notification as a trigger to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s)\nwith the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s) while maintaining N3\n(user plane connectivity) and other UE context information. For\nsubsequent N2 message, if the backup AMF information of the\ncorresponding failed AMF is not available the 5G-AN should select a\ndifferent AMF (as in clause6.3.5) from the same AMF set when the\nsubsequent N2 message needs to be sent for the UE(s). If no other AMF\n\nQuestion: What actions are taken when an AMF fails and is detected by the 5G-AN? [3GPP Release 18]\nOptions:\noption 1: AMF is deregistered from NRF\noption 2: AMF is marked as failed in the 5G-AN\noption 3: NGAP UE-TNLA-binding is released for CM-CONNECTED UE(s)\noption 4: Backup AMF is selected if available\noption 5: Notification is sent to peer CP NFs about the AMF failure\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 2: AMF is marked as failed in the 5G-AN\n"

During the\nprocedure, the NG-RAN sends a RAN Paging to the UE in order to trigger\nthe Connection Resume in RRC\\_INACTIVE procedure in clause4.8.2.2.  \nFigure 4.8.2.2a-1: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in\nRRC\\_INACTIVE  \n1\\. The NG-RAN receives downlink data (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or the\nuser plane PDU) for a UE in RRC\\_INACTIVE State, the NG-RAN buffers the\ndownlink data and triggers RAN Paging message.  \nIf the NG RAN supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service\nfeature and if the UE context in NG-RAN indicates that the UE supports\nthe Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature, the NG RAN shall\nprovide the Voice Service Indication in the RAN Paging message for the\nUE when it detects that the downlink data which triggers the RAN Paging\nmessage is related to voice service, as specified in clause5.38.3 of\nTS23.501\\[2\\].  \n2\\. The NG-RAN sends the RAN Paging message to the UE.  \n3\\. If the UE is in RRC\\_INACTIVE State, based on the RAN paging and the\nUE decides to accept the paging, the UE initiates the UE Triggered\nConnection Resume in RRC\\_INACTIVE procedure (see clause4.8.2.2).  \n#### 4.8.2.2b Network Triggered Connection Resume in RRC\\_INACTIVE with CN based MT communication handling  \nWhen the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC\\_INACTIVE state with CN based\nmobile terminating (MT) communication handling, high latency\ncommunication as described in clause5.31.8 of TS23.501\\[2\\] is\napplied.  \nThis procedure may be triggered by MT data, or a N1 procedure from SMF\n\nInformation 3:\nnode shall initiate the AN Release procedure (see clause4.2.6 of\nTS23.502\\[3\\]) to move the UE CM state in the AMF to CM-IDLE state and\nindicate to the AMF the NAS non-delivery.  \n\\- If NG-RAN has only pending user plane data for transmission, the\nNG-RAN node may keep the N2 connection active and based on\nimplementation send indication to the CN requesting the CN based mobile\nterminated (MT) communication handling as described in\nclause5.31.7.2.1, or initiate the AN Release procedure (see\nclause4.2.6 of TS23.502\\[3\\]) based on local configuration in NG-RAN.  \nNOTE3: The user plane data which triggers the RAN paging can be lost,\ne.g. in the case of RAN paging failure.  \nIf a UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC\\_INACTIVE state performs cell selection\nto GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, it shall follow idle mode procedures of the\nselected RAT as specified in clause5.17.  \nIn addition, a UE in CM-CONNECTED state with RRC\\_INACTIVE state shall\nenter CM-IDLE state and initiates the NAS signalling recovery (see\nTS24.501\\[47\\]) in the following cases:  \n\\- If RRC resume procedure fails,  \nIf the UE receives Core Network paging,  \n\\- If the periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer expires and the UE\ncannot successfully resume the RRC Connection,  \n\\- In any other failure scenario that cannot be resolved in\nRRC\\_INACTIVE state and requires the UE to move to CM-IDLE state.  \nWhen a UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC\\_INACTIVE state, and a trigger to\nchange the UE\\'s NG-RAN or E\u2011UTRAN UE Radio Capability information\nhappens, the UE shall move to CM-IDLE state and initiate the procedure\nfor updating UE Radio Capability defined in clause5.4.4.1. (For\nspecific requirements for a UE operating in dual-registration mode see\nclause5.17.2.1)  \nWhen UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC\\_INACTIVE state, if RAN has received\nLocation Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type\nindicating single stand-alone report or continuously reporting whenever\n\nInformation 4:\n4\\. The AMF can send a Cancel UE State Notification message to inform\nthe NG-RAN that it should terminate notifications for a given UE when\nsuch report is not needed.  \n#### 6.1.3.2 Network triggered Connection Resume procedure  \nThis is an updated procedure based on clause4.8.2.2a of TS23.502\\[3\\]\nwith enhancement for UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC\\_INACTIVE state and\neDRX is longer than 10.24s.  \nThe Network Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure is\nused when the network needs to signal (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or\ndownlink user plane PDU) with a UE in the RRC Inactive state. When the\nprocedure is triggered by other NFs (e.g. SMSF, LMF, GMLC), the UPF (or\nSMF) in the following figure should be replaced by the respective NF\n(the corresponding services operations used by other NFs when they\ncommunicate with AMF may also be different from the service operation\nused by SMF/UPF). During the procedure, the NG-RAN (i.e. gNB) sends a\nRAN Paging to the UE in order to trigger the Connection Resume in RRC\nInactive procedure.  \nFigure 6.1.3.2-1a: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in RRC\nInactive  \nFigure 6.1.3.2-1b: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in RRC\nInactive  \n1\\. When downlink data is received and the SMF/UPF is requested to\nperform buffering as specified in clause6.1.3.1 above, UPF/SMF checks\nwith AMF for the possibility of data delivery, similar to step2 of\nclause4.24.2 of TS23.502\\[3\\] with the following differences:  \n\\- If AMF determines that UE is not reachable in RRC INACTIVE state, the\nAMF provides the Estimated Maximum Wait time in the response message\nbased on the stored extended DRX information for RRC INACTIVE in AMF\n(see clause6.1.3.1 above). This handling is similar to CM-IDLE with\neDRX. When the AMF provides the Estimated Maximum Wait time, it can\nconsider the time needed for RRC level procedures (e.g. RRC RNA update\nprocedure) when UE wakes up from the eDRX cycle.\n\nInformation 5:\nprocedure) when UE wakes up from the eDRX cycle.  \n2\\. When the AMF determines the UE reachable based on the stored\nextended DRX inform for RRC INACTIVE, the AMF informs SMF/UPF to deliver\ndata. The NG-RAN receives downlink data (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or the\nuser plane PDU) for a UE in RRC INACTIVE State, the NG-RAN buffers the\ndownlink data and triggers RAN Paging message.  \nAs an alternative option, the AMF may notify the NG-RAN of MT service\nwhich can trigger the NG-RAN Paging. Then step for downlink data\ndelivery will be executed after UE enters RRC\\_CONNECTED mode as show in\nfigure 6.1.3.2-1b above when SMF/UPF receives the notification as\nspecified in step3 of clause6.1.3.1 above.  \n3\\. The NG-RAN sends the RAN Paging message to the UE.  \n4\\. If the UE is in RRC Inactive State, based on the RAN paging, the UE\ninitiates the UE Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive procedure\n(see clause4.8.2.2 of TS23.502\\[3\\]).

In case of CA, when no transmission takes place on an\nactivated SCell, a reference power is used to provide a virtual report.\nTo allow network to detect UL power reduction, the PHR reports may also\ncontain Power Management Maximum Power Reduction (P-MPR, see TS 38.101-2\n\\[35\\]) information that UE uses to ensure UE compliance with the\nMaximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) exposure regulation for FR2, which is\nset for limiting RF exposure on human body.

        "answer": "option 1: The rating of untrusted AF(s)",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 6.2.13 Rating untrusted AF data sources  \n#### 6.2.13.1 General  \nWhen using an untrusted AF as data source, NWDAF may consider the data\nsource rating results. The rating of untrusted AF is based on the\nquality of data collected.  \nSuch rating may be triggered when the accuracy check based on the\ncalculation between the predicted and ground-truth data indicates low\nperformance, while the untrusted data source rating may be performed\nbased on NWDAF internal logic. In the selection of the appropriate data\nsources, the NWDAF may use the rate of untrusted AF data sources as a\ncriterion to calculate the expected confidence degree.  \n#### 6.2.13.2 Procedure for rating untrusted AF data sources  \nThe process of rating untrusted AF data sources is depicted in Figure\n6.2.13.2. For realizing potential issues, the NWDAF containing AnLF\nsubscribes to the NWDAF containing MTLF, which performs an accuracy\ncalculation based on the predicted and ground-truth data or\nalternatively the NWDAF containing AnLF can calculate the accuracy\nlocally by comparing the predicted and ground-truth data.  \nFigure 6.2.13.2: NWDAF containing AnLF-based untrusted AF data source\nrating  \n1\\. NWDAF containing AnLF subscribes to NWDAF containing MTLF for\nobtaining an ML model using the Nnwdaf\\_ModelProvision\\_Subscribe\nservice operation. The NWDAF containing AnLF may include a threshold (as\ndescribed in clause6.2E.2) to indicate when the NWDAF containing MTLF\nneeds to execute the accuracy monitoring operations.  \n**Option 1: Accuracy report from NWDAF containing MTLF**  \n2a. NWDAF containing MTLF evaluates the ML model correctness according\nto clause6.2E.2.  \n2b. An accuracy report is sent to the NWDAF containing AnLF, e.g. when\nthe reporting threshold is met by invoking\nNnwdaf\\_MLModelProvision\\_Notify service operation.  \n**Option 2: NWDAF containing AnLF computes accuracy**  \n2c. NWDAF containing AnLF calculates the accuracy by comparing the\npredictions with ground truth data.\n\nInformation 2:\npredictions with ground truth data.  \n2d. NWDAF containing AnLF is aware that the ML Model used has a low\naccuracy either by receiving the accuracy report in step2b or\nmonitoring the accuracy by itself in step2c. NWDAF containing AnLF\ndetermines that it needs to check further the data sources and compute\ndata source rating. The decision conditions upon which it needs to\ninitiate data source rating for a data source is based on NWDAF\ncontaining AnLF implementation.  \n3a-3b. NWDAF containing AnLF initiates rating of a data source by\nrequesting and receiving supplementary data, i.e. via\nNnwdaf\\_DataManagement\\_Fetch / Ndccf\\_DataManagement\\_Notify, from\ndifferent data sources (if available) to verify the data source quality\nor correctness. Such data can be for example performance data from the\nOAM which are supplementary to the data from untrusted AFs, or data from\nUPF supplementary to the data from untrusted AFs.  \n4\\. NWDAF containing AnLF updates the rating for the sources where\nuntrusted data is deviated from the supplementary trusted data per Event\nID.  \nNOTE1: An NWDAF containing AnLF determines the rating of an untrusted\nAF data source based on internal operations.  \n5a. NWDAF containing AnLF stores the untrusted AF data source rating\nlocally.  \n5b. NWDAF containing AnLF may send the untrusted AF data source rating\nto UDSF, if available. NWDAF containing AnLF uses the Nudsf\\_\nUnstructuredDataManagement\\_Create service operation.  \nNOTE2: To avoid an untrusted AF to be permanently excluded as a data\nsource, the NWDAF containing AnLF can re-rate the untrusted AF based on\nits internal logic. For example, it can rate the untrusted AF after some\ntimer expired.  \n6\\. A NWDAF consumer subscribes to a certain Analytics ID, using\nNnwdaf\\_AnalyticsSubscription\\_Subscribe service operation.  \nThe NWDAF containing AnLF retrieves the untrusted AF rating of the data\nsources either locally as described in step7a or from the UDSF as\n\nInformation 3:\nsources either locally as described in step7a or from the UDSF as\ndescribed in step7b, before collecting the data needed for the\nsubscribed Analytic ID.  \n7a. The NWDAF containing AnLF retrieves the untrusted AF rating of the\ndata sources locally.  \n7b. The NWDAF containing AnLF retrieves the untrusted AF rating of the\ndata sources from the UDSF using the to use Nudsf\\_\nUnstructuredDataManagement\\_Query service operation.  \n8\\. If the rating of one or more untrusted AF is below a threshold (i.e.\nthat is pre-configured), then the NWDAF containing AnLF can:  \n\\(i\\) select an alternative untrusted AF (if available) with higher\nrating; or  \n\\(ii\\) request supplementary data from other trusted data sources.  \n9\\. The NWDAF containing AnLF subscribes to a new data source to receive\nalternative or supplementary data if a new data source is selected in\nstep8.  \n10\\. The NWDAF may use the rate of untrusted AF data sources as a\ncriterion to calculate the confidence level of the respective analytics\noutput.  \n11\\. The NWDAF containing AnLF provides the analytics output to the\nanalytics consumer, using the Nnwdaf\\_AnalyticsSubscription\\_Notify\nservice operation.\n\nInformation 4:\nfrom NWDAF containing MTLF or ADRF is outside of 3GPP scope.  \n11\\. NWDAF containing AnLF decrypts the received ML model per the\nvendor\\'s implementation and how the ML model is decrypted is outside of\n3GPP scope.  \nNOTE 3: How the solution addresses the first security requirement is not\naddressed in the present document.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.63.1 Description  \nThis solution addresses Key Issue \\#1 and especially how to detect and\nimprove correctness of NWDAF analytics by enabling a rating of the data\nsources.  \nSuch rating can be based on (i) local estimation/calculation between the\npredicted and ground-truth data, (ii) the analytics consumer feedback,\nor (iii) provided by an AF in the forms of weights.  \nHence, NWDAF relates a rating to the data source profiles/reputation,\nwhich can be used as criterion for selecting from which sources to\ncollect data. In the selection of the appropriate data source, the NWDAF\ncan also use as a criterion the expected confidence degree, i.e. that\nrelates the outcome result with the input data sources.  \nSuch solution is more relevant for data sources which are not within the\nnetwork operator premises to control and check easily errors and\nsecurity. For these types of sources, the quality of the data needs to\nbe checked and shall not be consumed by the NWDAF MTLF especially if\nthere is a significant change in the data distribution or if there is a\nsignificant drift between predictions and ground truth data, which\nimpacts the performance of the accuracy.  \nThe rating process can be performed by AnLF or by a new NF, like TRLF.  \nWe assume here that AnLF is not biased, towards specific data sources\n(e.g. same vendor data source).  \nThe proposed solution only applies to the data from 3rd party data\nsources.  \nThe proposed solution cannot be applied for all types of data sources,\nbut only for the ones that provide performance measurements or KPIs,\nwhich can be obtained via more than one way.\n\nQuestion: What does the NWDAF containing MTLF consider when using untrusted AF(s) as data sources? [3GPP Release 18]\nOptions:\noption 1: The rating of untrusted AF(s)\noption 2: The accuracy of ML models\noption 3: Both option 1 and option 2\noption 4: None of the above\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 3: Both option 1 and option 2\n"

Although range length for\nthe DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference\nvalue of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations. Furthermore, the\nmaximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band\nn259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz). The highest frequency to be considered for\nthe SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262: 48.2 GHz.\nUsing the reference range length of 0.725m we determine free space path\nloss at f=48.2 GHz, as shown in Figure 7.1-1 below.  \n![](media/image93.emf){width=\"4.0in\" height=\"3.000103893263342in\"}  \nFigure 7.1-1: Free space path loss vs. frequency for d=0.725m  \nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in free space path loss\nfrom 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.9 dB.  \nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is\ncable loss per meter. Using the datasheets from five different\ncommercially available RF cables, which are rated up to 50 GHz, the\naverage cable loss per meter is calculated (averaging performed in\nlinear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.1-2 below.  \n![](media/image94.emf){width=\"4.0in\" height=\"3.000103893263342in\"}  \nFigure 7.1-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency  \nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in cable loss per meter\nfrom 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.33 dB.  \nThe SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses\nand additional margin, and it is feasible to reuse these parameters for\nthe calculations related to band n262.  \nThe SNR calculation also includes two parameters which are taken from UE\nRF requirements: REFSENS and multi-band relaxation.

In this case the SMF in HPLMN\nselects the UPF(s) in the HPLMN and the SMF in VPLMN selects the UPF(s)\nin the VPLMN. This is further described in clause6.3. Home Routed with\nSession Breakout in VPLMN (HR-SBO) is described in clause6.7 of\nTS23.548\\[130\\].  \nNOTE1: The use of an UPF in the VPLMN e.g. enables VPLMN charging,\nVPLMN LI and minimizes the impact on the HPLMN of the UE mobility within\nthe VPLMN (e.g. for scenarios where SSC mode 1 applies).  \nDifferent simultaneous PDU Sessions of an UE may use different modes:\nHome Routed and LBO.

More specifically, the UE can\naccess to SNPN service by an LBO PDU Session, at the same time the UE\ncan access to the PLMN services:  \n\\- by the HR PDU session, which makes use of the SNPN resources (RAN,\nUPF), or  \n\\- by a secondary registration and a subsequent non-roaming PDU session,\nwhich makes use of the PLMN RAN resources.  \nThe former applies to the SR UE while the latter applies to the DR UE.\nCertainly, this should allow the SNPN operator to control whether a UE\ncan establish an HR PDU session via SNPN, and allow the PLMN operator to\ncontrol whether a UE can perform the secondary 3GPP registration at the\nPLMN.  \n\\- To enable the control of the SNPN operator, taking the UE\nsubscription, UE capability (SR or DR), local policy and agreements\nbetween SNPN and PLMN into account, the SNPN can make a decision whether\nthe HR PDU session targeting to the PLMN services is allowed, or\nindicate the UE to establish the PDU session targeting to the PLMN\nservices via PLMN cell or SNPN cell, e.g. via URSP.  \n\\- To enable the control of the PLMN operator, taking the UE\nsubscription, UE capability, local policy and network topology (whether\n5GC is shared between SNPN and PLMN, e.g. Solution \\#3) into account,\nthe SNPN or PLMN can indicate the UE whether secondary registration is\nallowed and whether the GUTI assigned by SNPN can be reused. Therefore,\nthe UE can determine to perform the secondary 3GPP registration at the\nPLMN based on local configuration, UE capability and the network\nindication.

The Multi-USIM device registers to network-A and network-B\nrespectively. During the registration procedure if the UE desires to\nhave network assistance for collision avoidance (e.g. because the use\nhas activated more than one USIM) the UE indicates Multi-USIM\ncapabilities support and the networks indicate whether they support\npaging collision avoidance by changing of NAS parameters.  \n2\\. The Multi-USIM UE calculates Paging Occasion and it determines\nwhether Paging Collision can happen.  \n3\\. If the Multi-USIM UE determines that Paging Collision can happen,\nthe Multi-USIM UE next selects a registered network supporting UE\nrequest for change of NAS parameters (e.g., network-B) and performs a\nMobility Registration Update on that network. The Registration Request\nincludes a new UE ID request indication and includes information to\nassist the AMF for assignment of the new 5G-GUTI, e.g. requested UE-ID\nvalue or range. The assistance information can be in the format of\nUE\\_ID that provides the best timing of the paging.  \n4\\. The AMF allocates a new 5G-GUTI for the Multi-USIM device in the\nRegistration Accept. When the AMF allocates the new 5G-GUTI, the AMF\nshall consider the assistance information provided by the UE. AMF should\nnot allocate a new 5G-GUTI which does not fulfil the assistance\ninformation The AMF may also change the DRX parameters.  \n5\\. Upon receiving the new 5G-GUTI, the Multi-USIM UE re-calculates the\nPaging Occasion for network-B.  \nNOTE: This procedure is defined for 5GS only. It can also be used in\nmixed scenarios (i.e. when the UE is connected to both EPS and 5GS), but\nis always executed only on the 5GS side.  \nIf the UE determines that paging collision can happen upon reception of\na new 5G-TMSI in the Registration Accept message, the UE may immediately\ninclude a new UE ID request indication in the Registration Complete\n\nInformation 5:\nlead to partial overlap of the POs, which can still lead to degraded\nperformance in terms of paging detection.  \nIt should be noted that the paging occasions in EPS are calculated based\non a permanent subscription identifier (IMSI), which means that in the\nunfortunate case where the IMSIs associated with the two USIM cards are\nmatching in the last 10 bits, the paging collisions will be systematic.\nThis also means that any solution for paging collision avoidance, once\nactivated, will be definitive.  \nIn contrast, the paging occasions in 5GS are calculated based on a\ntemporary identifier (5G-S-TMSI) which can be reassigned over time. The\nfrequency of 5G-S-TMSI reassignment today is left to the operator. Given\nthat the 5G-S-TMSI is used to prevent identity-based tracking, in the\nextreme case the network can decide to assign a new 5G-S-TMSI every time\nthe UE performs a Mobility Registration procedure. Due to the frequent\n5G-S-TMSI reassignment in one or the other system, the possibility for\npaging collisions can arise at any time.  \nThe last two paragraphs considered the cases where the UE is\nsimultaneously registered to two EPSs or two 5GSs. It is also possible\nfor the UE to be simultaneously registered in EPS (with USIM1) and in\n5GS (with USIM2). In this case the paging occasions in EPS will be based\non the permanent identifier (IMSI), whereas the paging occasions in 5GS\nwill be based on a temporary identifier (5G-S-TMSI). In this case, too,\nthe possibility for paging collisions can dynamically arise at any time,\nsimilar to the case where UE is registered to two 5GSs.\n\nQuestion: Which USIM registration triggers the allocation of a new 5G-GUTI for the Paging Timing Collision Control feature?

Thus information\ncan be compared and missing information can be identified.  \n#### 4.5.8.2 Tracking of IM CN subsystem functional entities generating charging information  \nEach IM CN subsystem functional entity that generates charging events,\nincludes its own address or specific IM CN subsystem functional entity\nidentifier within the \\\"fe-addr\\\" element of the \\\"fe-identifier\\\"\nheader field parameter of the P-Charging-Vector header field into the\ninitial SIP request to be sent from own domain.  \nThe last element of the operator domain stores the \\\"fe-identifier\\\"\nheader field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field and removes\nthe \\\"fe-identifier\\\" header field parameter from the P-Charging-Vector\nheader field.  \nWhen receiving the final SIP response sent back to its own domain, the\nlast element of the operator domain deletes, if received, the\n\\\"fe-identifier\\\" header field parameter from the P-Charging-Vector\nheader field, adds the stored \\\"fe-identifier\\\" and adds its own\n\\\"fe-addr\\\" to the \\\"fe-identifier\\\".  \n#### 4.5.8.3 Tracking of applications generating charging information\n\nQuestion: What additional information is included in the initial SIP request for tracking IMS NEs generating charging information?

In other words the *y\\'*-axis of the LCS is\nparallel to the *y*-axis of the GCS. Considering a BS antenna element\nthe *x*-axis of the GCS is aligned with the pointing direction of the\nsector. Mechanical downtilt is modelled as a rotation of the LCS around\nthe *y*-axis. For zero mechanical downtilt the LCS coincides with the\nGCS.  \nThis transformation relates the spherical angles (,) in the global\ncoordinate system to spherical angles (,) in the local (antenna-fixed)\ncoordinate system and is defined as follows:  \n(7.1-18)  \n(7.1-19)  \nwhere is the mechanical tilt angle around the *y*-axis as defined in\nFigure 7.1.4.

The\ndotted and double-dotted marks indicate that the rotations are\nintrinsic, which means that they are the result of one (\u22c5) or two (\u22c5\u22c5)\nintermediate rotations. In other words, the axis is the original y axis\nafter the first rotation about z, and the axis is the original x axis\nafter the first rotation about z and the second rotation about. A first\nrotation of *\u03b1* about *z* sets the antenna bearing angle (i.e. the\nsector pointing direction for a BS antenna element). The second rotation\nof *\u03b2* about sets the antenna downtilt angle. Finally, the third\nrotation of *\u03b3* about sets the antenna slant angle. The orientation of\nthe *x*, *y* and *z* axes after all three rotations can be denoted as,\nand. These triple-dotted axes represents the final orientation of the\nLCS, and for notational purposes denoted as the *x\\'*, *y\\'* and *z\\'*\naxes (local or \\\"primed\\\" coordinate system).  \nIn order to establish the equations for transformation of the coordinate\nsystem and the polarized antenna field patterns between the GCS and the\nLCS, it is necessary to determine the composite rotation matrix that\ndescribes the transformation of point (*x*, *y*, *z*) in the GCS into\npoint (*x\\'*, *y\\'*, *z\\'*) in the LCS. This rotation matrix is computed\nas the product of three elemental rotation matrices. The matrix to\ndescribe rotations about the *z*,and axes by the angles *\u03b1*, *\u03b2* and *\u03b3*\nrespectively and in that order is defined as  \n(7.1-2)  \nThe reverse transformation is given by the inverse of *R*, which is also\nequal to the transpose of *R* since it is orthogonal.  \n(7.1-3)  \nThe simplified forward and reverse composite rotation matrices are given\nby  \n(7.1-4)  \nand  \n(7.1-5)\n\nInformation 3:\n### 7.1.3 Transformation from a LCS to a GCS  \nA GCS with coordinates (*x*, *y*, *z*,, ) and unit vectors (, ) and an\nLCS with \\\"primed\\\" coordinates (*x\\'*, *y\\'*, *z\\'*,, ) and \\\"primed\\\"\nunit vectors (, ) are defined with a common origins in Figures 7.1.3-1\nand 7.1.3-2.

It is assumed that the far-field is known\nin the LCS by formulae. The placement of an array within the GCS is\ndefined by the translation between the GCS and a LCS. The orientation of\nthe array with respect to the GCS is defined in general by a sequence of\nrotations (described in clause 7.1.3).

The eNB\nschedules transmission resources for transmission of sidelink control\ninformation and data;  \n\\- The UE sends a scheduling request (D-SR or Random Access) to the eNB\nfollowed by a Sidelink BSR. Based on the Sidelink BSR the eNB can\ndetermine that the UE has data for a sidelink communication transmission\nand estimate the resources needed for transmission. eNB can schedule\ntransmission resources for sidelink communication using configured\nSL-RNTI.  \n\\- UE autonomous resource selection is characterized by:  \n\\- A UE on its own selects resources from resource pools and performs\ntransport format selection to transmit sidelink control information and\ndata;  \n\\- There can be up to 8 transmission pools either pre-configured for out\nof coverage operation or provided by RRC signalling for in-coverage\noperation. Each pool can have one or more PPPP associated with it. For\ntransmission of a MAC PDU, the UE selects a transmission pool in which\none of the associated PPPP is equal to the PPPP of a logical channel\nwith highest PPPP among the logical channel identified in the MAC PDU.\nIt is up to UE implementation how the UE selects amongst multiple pools\nwith same associated PPPP. There is a one to one association between\nsidelink control pool and sidelink data pool;  \n\\- Once the resource pool is selected, the selection is valid for the\nentire Sidelink Control period. After the Sidelink Control period is\nfinished the UE may perform resource pool selection again.  \nNOTE: The UE is allowed to perform multiple transmissions to different\ndestinations in a single Sidelink Control period.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 9.3.1 Uplink  \nFor the UE to request resources from the Node B(s), Scheduling Requests\nwill be transmitted in the uplink in the form of Scheduling Information\nand Happy Bit (FDD only). The Scheduling information will be transmitted\nfor the logical channels for which RRC configured that reporting needed\nto be made. For FDD, the Happy Bit shall always be included in the\nE-DPCCH, whenever the E-DPCCH is transmitted.  \n#### 9.3.1.1 Scheduling information  \n##### 9.3.1.1.1 Content  \nThe UE includes the following in the Scheduling Information (only taking\ninto account the logical channels for which RRC configured that\nreporting was required and always excluding logical channels mapped on\nnon-scheduled MAC-d flows):  \n\\- Logical channel ID of the highest priority channel with data in\nbuffer, on 4 bits. The logical channel ID field identifies unambigiouly\nthe highest priority logical channel with available data and QoS\ninformation related to this indicated logical channel;  \n\\- UE Buffer occupancy (in Bytes):  \n\\- Buffer status for the highest priority logical channel with data in\nbuffer, on 4 bits, as a fraction of the total reported buffer;  \n\\- Total buffer status, on 5 bits;  \n\\- UE Power Headroom (UPH): For FDD, the UPH field indicates the ratio\nof the maximum UE transmission power and the corresponding DPCCH code\npower defined in \\[7\\]. For TDD, the UPH field indicates the ratio of\nthe maximum power and the calculated UE transmit power as defined in\n\\[10\\] with \u03b2~e~ = 0. The UPH field is 5 bits.  \n\\- For TDD: Path Loss:  \n> \\- Information derived from measurements of serving cell and neighbour\n> cell\\'s RSCP (5 bits);  \n##### 9.3.1.1.2 Triggers  \nIn the case where the UE is not allowed to transmit scheduled data\n(because it has no Serving Grant available or it has received an\nAbsolute Grant preventing it from transmitting in any process) and it\nhas Scheduled data to send on a logical channel for which Scheduling\nInformation shall be reported:  \n\\- For FDD:\n\nInformation 5:\nInitially, both the 3GPP and non 3GPP access RTT is below the threshold\nand UE and UPF schedulers e.g. use round robin mechanism in such a way\nthat 50% weight is enforced. However, at some point of time, the UL\ndelay in 3GPP access increases beyond the maximum threshold In this\ncase, the UE reduces the traffic via that access through reducing the\nLoad Balancing weight by 100%. The UE may also have chosen a different\nLoad Balancing weight, e.g. 20% over 3GPP access and 80% over non-3GPP\naccess. Once the situation is recovered, the UE scheduler will apply\nagain the round robin mechanism considering the 50% weight. If the\ntraffic distribution is observed for a longer period, e.g. during the\nbusy hour, the effective average load balancing weight achieved in UL\nwill be less than the prescribed 50% in UL, e.g.30% for UL and 50% for\nDL on 3GPP access, and 70% for UL and 50% for DL on non 3GPP access, as\nshown in the figure. The \\\"longer term\\\" load balancing weight may thus\ndiffer from the weight factor prescribed in the PCC rule, since the\nthresholds and access link conditions have been taken into account based\non the thresholds provided to UE and UPF. The target for UE/UPF is\nhowever always to fulfil the operator\\'s prescribed weight provided by\nPCF, if the link conditions allow it. In this way the operator use case\nis maintained at the same time as access link conditions are taken into\naccount to ensure a good QoE.  \nNOTE1: It is up to the UE and UPF scheduler implementation on how to\nschedule when several performance conditions are configured. It is up to\nthe implementation how frequently the KPI measurements are monitored.  \nFigure 6.15.2-1: Steering mode example (average weight over some time)  \nThis steering mode enhancement can be applied by the MPTCP, ATSSS-LL and\n(MP)QUIC steering functionalities.\n\nQuestion: How does the scheduler assign resources between UEs?

(if AF has indicated that buffering of uplink traffic to the target\nDNAI is no more needed as traffic to the target DNAI /EAS is now\nauthorized by the AF) The SMF updates the PSA2 by indicating the PSA2 to\nsend the buffered uplink packets (step 8b) and to stop buffering.  \nThe SMF releases PSA1.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.31.2 Procedure for EAS relocation  \nFigure 6.31.2-1: Application Relocation with UE assistance  \n1\\. If the EAS relocation for this application needs coordination from\n5GC, the AF subscribes to late and early notification. The AF request\nmay include the application relocation possibility indication and the\n\\'AF acknowledgement to be expected\\' indication. The AF request may\nalso indicate no DNAI change to 5GC for this application if the service\ncontinuity need to be supported.  \n2\\. The PCF generates PCC rules based on the AF request and provides the\nPCC rules to the SMF. This stepmay happen during establishment of the\nPDU Session or during modification of the PDU Session.  \n3\\. The SMF determines to select a new UPF, e.g. a new ULCL/L-PSA is to\nbe inserted. The trigger of the new ULCL/L-PSA insertion may be\ntriggered due to UE mobility.  \n4\\. Based on the subscription, the SMF may send an early notification to\nthe AF, including the corresponding DNAI.  \n5\\. The AF may select a new EAS based on the new DNAI. This stepmay be\ntriggered by step4, or by application layer events, e.g. load condition\nof the old EAS. In the latter case, the AF may select a new EAS and\ndetermine the DNAI(s) based on local configuration or relocation-related\ninformation (e.g. delay and UE location info) obtained from 5GC (e.g.\nSMF).  \n6\\. Based on the trigger of the EAS relocation, the AF gives a feedback\nto SMF.  \n6a. If the EAS relocation is triggered by SMF notification, the AF sends\na positive response to the early notification to the SMF.  \nIn the positive response, the AF includes information to be provided to\nthe UE, including either the address of the new EAS or indication for\napplication server relocation, corresponding DNAI and its FQDN selected\nby the AF. The AF may further include a UE port number, if available.\nThe UE port number identifies a port at the UE side that the UE uses to\nconnect to the source EAS.

The AMF considers the NAS\nsignalling connection is released if it detects the N2 context is\nreleased.  \n#### 5.3.3.4 Support of a UE connected over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access  \nThe AMF manages two CM states for an UE: a CM state for 3GPP access and\na CM state for Non-3GPP access. An N2 interface can serve the UE for\neither 3GPP access or for Non 3GPP access. UE connected over both 3GPP\nand Non-3GPP has got two N2 interfaces, one for each access. A UE may be\nin any combination of the CM states between 3GPP and Non-3GPP access,\ne.g. a UE may be CM-IDLE for one access and CM-CONNECTED for the other\naccess, CM-IDLE for both accesses or CM-CONNECTED for both accesses.  \nWhen the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE for 3GPP access and\nCM-CONNECTED for Non-3GPP access, the AMF shall perform a network\ntriggered Service Request procedure, when it has downlink data to be\nsent to this UE for 3GPP access, by sending either the Paging Request\nvia 3GPP access or the NAS notification via Non-3GPP access to this UE\n(see clause4.2.3.3 of TS23.502\\[3\\]).  \nConnection Management over Non-3GPP access is further defined in\nclause5.5.2.\n\nInformation 4:\nNG-RAN:  \n**RAN awareness of slices**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports a differentiated handling of traffic for different\nnetwork slices which have been pre-configured. How NG-RAN supports the\nslice enabling in terms of NG-RAN functions (i.e. the set of network\nfunctions that comprise each slice) is implementation dependent.  \n**Selection of RAN part of the network slice**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports the selection of the RAN part of the network slice,\nby NSSAI provided by the UE or the 5GC which unambiguously identifies\none or more of the pre-configured network slices in the PLMN.  \n**Resource management between slices**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports policy enforcement between slices as per service\nlevel agreements. It should be possible for a single NG-RAN node to\nsupport multiple slices. The NG-RAN should be free to apply the best RRM\npolicy for the SLA in place to each supported slice.  \n**Support of QoS**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports QoS differentiation within a slice, and per\nSlice-Maximum Bit Rate may be enforced per UE, if feasible. How NG-RAN\nenables UE-Slice-MBR enforcement and rate limitation (see TS 23.501\n\\[3\\]) is up to network implementation.  \n**RAN selection of CN entity**  \n\\- For initial attach, the UE may provide NSSAI to support the selection\nof an AMF. If available, NG-RAN uses this information for routing the\ninitial NAS to an AMF. If the NG-RAN is unable to select an AMF using\nthis information or the UE does not provide any such information the\nNG-RAN sends the NAS signalling to one of the default AMFs.  \n\\- For subsequent accesses, the UE provides a Temp ID, which is assigned\nto the UE by the 5GC, to enable the NG-RAN to route the NAS message to\nthe appropriate AMF as long as the Temp ID is valid (NG-RAN is aware of\nand can reach the AMF which is associated with the Temp ID). Otherwise,\nthe methods for initial attach applies.  \n**Resource isolation between slices**  \n\\- The NG-RAN supports resource isolation between slices.

The AMF gets Nnrf\\_NFDiscovery service response with one or more\nprofile(s) of SMF(s) in HPLMN.  \n4\\. The AMF selects an SMF instance in HPLMN (H-SMF endpoint).  \n5\\. The AMF builds a Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_CreateSMContext Request that\nincludes the endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF in the body of\nthe request. If the AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is\nconfigured to apply it, the AMF sends the\nNsmf\\_PDUSession\\_CreateSMContext Request with Discovery & Selection\nparameters to the selected SCP in the VPLMN. Discovery & Selection\nparameters include S-NSSAI, UE location (TAI), i.e. parameter for V-SMF\nselection.  \n6\\. \\[Optional\\] The SCP in VPLMN sends Nnrf\\_NFDiscovery Request to the\nV-NRF using Discovery & Selection parameters received from AMF.  \n7\\. \\[Optional\\] The SCP in VPLMN gets Nnrf\\_NFDiscovery service\nresponse with profile(s) of SMF(s) in VPLMN.  \n8\\. The SCP in VPLMN selects an SMF instance in VPLMN (V-SMF), which\nsupports the Discovery & Selection parameters received earlier from the\nAMF.  \n9\\. The SCP in VPLMN forwards the Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_CreateSMContext\nRequest received from the AMF to the selected SMF instance in VPLMN.  \n10\\. If the V-SMF does not support delegated SMF discovery or is not\nconfigured to apply it (CaseA), the V-SMF sends\nNsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Create Request directly to the H-SMF. Otherwise\n(CaseB), the V-SMF sends the Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Create Request to the\nSCP in VPLMN but adds Discovery & Selection parameter set to H-SMF\nendpoint received from the AMF. In both cases, the V-SMF uses the\nreceived endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF to construct the\ntarget destination to be addressed.  \nNOTE: The Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Create Request sent by the V-SMF in CaseA\nand in CaseB is the same apart from the Discovery & Selection\n\nInformation 5:\n(Neasdf\\_DNSContext\\_Create) and may select and configure UPF(s) in\nHPLMN as in step3b-2. For the V-SMF removal case, the steps 4 to 10 are\nskipped.  \n4a. (V-SMF insertion case) The (target) V-SMF retrieves SM context from\nH-SMF using Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Context Request/Response, followed by the\nNsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Context Request/Response.  \n4b. (V-SMF change case) The target V-SMF retrieves SM context from the\nsource V-SMF using Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Context Request/Response indicating\nHR-SBO support in the Request in the case of an intra-PLMN V-SMF case.  \nIn step4b, if source and target V-SMFs belong to same VPLMN, the SM\ncontext from the source V-SMF includes Authorization Result for HR-SBO,\nVPLMN Specific Offloading Information, and (if previously received by\nsource V-SMF from H-SMF) the HPLMN address information, and the DNS\nServer address provided by the HPLMN.  \nNOTE1: Step4b in inter PLMN case (the target V-SMF retrieves SM\ncontext from the source V-SMF) assumes inter PLMN agreements on context\nexchange at both AMF and V-SMF levels.  \n5\\. As in step4 of Figure 6.7.2.6-1, the (target) V-SMF may invoke\nNeasdf\\_DNSContext\\_Create.  \n6\\. As in step5 of Figure 6.7.2.6-1, the (target) V-SMF may perform UL\nCL/BP and local PSA insertion/change/removal.  \n7\\. The target V-SMF invokes Nsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Update Request to the\nH-SMF as in step7 of Figure 6.7.2.6-1.  \n8\\. As in step8 of Figure 6.7.2.6-1, the H-SMF invokes Nudm\\_SDM\\_Get\nservice, authorizes the request for HR-SBO based on the SM subscription\ndata, and retrieves the VPLMN Specific Offloading Policy from H-PCF in\ncase the HR-SBO is authorized.  \n9\\. As in step9 of Figure 6.7.2.6-1, once the HR-SBO is authorized, the\nH-SMF sends the VPLMN Specific Offloading Information in the\nNsmf\\_PDUSession\\_Update Response message to the target V-SMF.  \nNOTE2: As the H-SMF sends VPLMN Specific Offloading Information related\nwith the target PLMN for inter-PLMN case, this allows to support\n\nQuestion: What information does the H-SMF provide in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response?

This description is only normative as\nfar as the consequential externally observable behaviour is concerned.  \nCertain sequences of actions of the two peer entities compose\n\\\"elementary procedures\\\" which are used as a basis for the description\nin this subclause. These elementary procedures may be grouped into the\nfollowing classes:  \n\\- call establishment procedures;  \n\\- call clearing procedures;  \n\\- call information phase procedures;  \n\\- miscellaneous procedures.\n\nInformation 3:\n(TI). A MS not assuming to be the originator of the transaction will\nchose the transaction identifier received from the network, setting the\nTI flag to 1+x mod 2 where x is the received TI flag.  \nThe present document describes the broadcast call control protocol only\nwith regard to two peer entities, one in a MS, the other one in the\nnetwork. The call control entities are described as communicating finite\nstate machines which exchange messages across the radio interface and\ncommunicate internally with other protocol (sub)layers. In particular,\nthe BCC protocol uses the MM and RR sublayer specified in 3GPP TS24.008\nand 3GPP TS44.018. The BCC entity in a MS that is not the originator of\nthe broadcast call shall not send messages to its peer entity. This\ndescription in only normative as far as the consequential externally\nobservable behaviour is concerned. For simplicity, instead of using the\nterms \\\"BCC entity in the MS\\\" and \\\"BCC entity in the network\\\", the\npresent document often uses the terms \\\"MS\\\" and \\\"network\\\" if no\nconfusion may arise.  \nCertain sequences of actions of the two peer entities compose\n\\\"elementary procedures\\\" which are used as a basis for the description\nin the present document. These elementary procedures are defined in\nclause6.  \nThe network should apply supervisory functions to verify that the BCC\nprocedures are progressing and if not, take appropriate means to resolve\nthe problems. This, however, is out of the scope of the present\ndocument.  \n6 Elementary procedures for Broadcast Call Control\n==================================================  \n6.1 Overview\n------------\n\nInformation 4:\n=============================================================  \nIn this clause, the services provided by signalling layer 3 on the\nnetwork side are described which belong to the CM sub\u2011layer functional\nblocks of CC, SMS, LCS, and SS. The services corresponding to further\nfunctional blocks of the CM sublayer are not further described in this\nclause.  \n7.1 Call control services\n-------------------------  \nThe Call Control services are provided by multiple CC entities at the\nservice access point MNCC\u2011SAP.  \nThe Call Control service class consists of the following services:  \n\\- call establishment;  \n\\- call maintaining;  \n\\- call termination;  \n\\- call related Supplementary Services Support.\n\nInformation 5:\n=============================================================  \nIn this clause, the services provided by signalling layer 3 on the\nnetwork side are described which belong to the CM sub\u2011layer functional\nblocks of CC, SMS, LCS, and SS.

Additionally to\nthe requirements specified for 3GPP2 system, a multi mode MS while\nregistered to a 3GPP2 VPLMN shall follow the requirements specified in\nclause4.4.3.3.  \nNOTE: It is assumed that the MS can determine the PLMN identity of\nnetworks supporting 3GPP2 technologies from the information broadcast\nover the air.  \n########  Annex A (normative): HPLMN Matching Criteria\n\nInformation 4:\n> of that document *in the same Release as the present document*.  \n\\[1\\] 3GPPTR 21.905: \\\"Vocabulary for 3GPP Specifications\\\".  \n\\[2\\] 3GPPTS 22.011: \\\"Service accessibility\\\".  \n3 Definitions and abbreviations\n===============================  \n3.1 Definitions\n---------------  \n**Multi mode terminal: Terminal which supports multiple access\ntechnologies and accesses 3GPP core network (e.g. GSM/UMTS).**  \n**Multi system terminal:** Terminal which supports both the 3GPP system\nand non-3GPP system(s).  \n**Non-3GPP system**: Mobile telecommunications system, having non-MAP\ncore network, with specifications which are outside the control or\ninfluence of 3GPP.  \n**3GPP system**: MAP core network and various access networks.  \n**3GPP2 system**: IS-41 core network and various cdma access network.  \nOther definitions are given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \\[1\\].  \n3.2 Abbreviations\n-----------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations\napply:  \nPRL Preferred Roaming List  \nGAIT GSM/ANSI-136 Interoperability  \nR-UIM Removable User Interface Module (a 3GPP2 abbreviation)  \nFurther abbreviations are given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \\[1\\].  \n4 Categories of multi system terminals\n======================================  \n4.1 Common characteristics\n--------------------------  \n\\- 3GPP and non-3GPP system(s) in the same terminal.  \n[Benefit to the user]{.underline}  \nIncreased coverage area.  \nWider range of services  \nCan use one terminal for both systems.  \n4.2 Category 1 - Manual switching\n---------------------------------  \n\\- The user manually selects system.  \n\\- Separate 3GPP and non-3GPP identities (e.g. USIM and R-UIM).  \n\\- When in 3GPP system, terminal does not scan non-3GPP systems and vice\nversa.  \n4.3 Category 2 - Automatic switching by an overlay function\n-----------------------------------------------------------  \n\\- When in 3GPP system, terminal scans non-3GPP systems and vice versa.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 5.4.1 Mechanism of mode selection in multi-mode terminals  \nThe physical layer of a Generic Access capable terminal may support any\nof a multiple of IP access technologies in addition to the GERAN radio\ninterface, in support of multi-mode operation. The generic access\nterminal contains an \\\"RR\\\" entity with functionality specific to\ngeneric access, namely the GAN RR. The GAN RR entity serves the upper\nlayers in identical fashion to the GSM RR entity, thereby ensuring that\nthere is no change in functionality in the upper layers of the protocol\nstack. Mode selection relates to which of the RR entities is serving the\nupper layers i.e. MM at any given time. At any given time, the MS is\ntherefore in one of two operating RR modes:  \n\\- 3GPP mode:\\\nIn this mode of operation, the GSM RR or UTRAN RRC entity in the MS\nserves the upper layers over the Um interface.  \n\\- GAN mode:\\\nIn this mode of operation, the GAN RR entity serves the upper layers\nover the Up interface.  \nThe user can configure the terminal to operate in one of the above two\nmodes at any given time. There can be however a default mode of\noperation that can be configured by the operator through various\nmechanisms, including terminal configuration. The operator may\nadditionally be able to set the mode configuration of a terminal through\nthe registration to GAN procedure.  \nOn power up, the MS always starts in 3GPP mode and executes the normal\npower-up sequence as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122. Following this, the MS\nmay switch into GAN mode based on mode selection preference determined\nby user preferences or operator configuration.  \nThe various preferences for the MS that are possible through operator\nconfiguration are as follows:  \n\\- GERAN/UTRAN-only:  \nThe MS RR entity remains in 3GPP mode and does not switch to GAN mode.  \n\\- GERAN/UTRAN-preferred:  \nThe MS RR entity is configured in 3GPP mode as long as there is a GSM\nPLMN available through GERAN. If no GSM PLMN is available through GERAN,\n\nQuestion: What must a multi-mode terminal do when it enters 3GPP mode of operation?

User Data Congestion related\nanalytics can relate to congestion experienced while transferring user\ndata over the control plane or user plane or both. A request for user\ndata congestion analytics relates to a specific area or to a specific\nuser. If the consumer of these analytics provides a UE ID, the NWDAF\ndetermines the area where the UE is located. The NWDAF then collects\nmeasurements per cell and uses the measurements to determine user data\ncongestion analytics.  \nThe request for user data congestion related analytics indicates the\nlocation area information where congestion related analytics is desired\nor indicates a UE Identity that can be used by the NWDAF to determine\nthe location area information where congestion related analytics is\ndesired. When requesting user data congestion, the consumer may request\nthe identifiers of the applications that contribute the most to the\ntraffic in the area. The consumer may indicate how many applications\nshould be reported by providing the maximum number of applications in\nthe request or subscription.  \nWhen the consumer of user data congestion related analytics subscribes\nto user data congestion related analytics, it may indicate a threshold\nand the NWDAF will provide analytics to the consumer when the congestion\nlevel crosses the threshold. The consumer can indicate an S-NSSAI in the\nrequest when congestion analytics are needed on a per slice level.  \nThe service consumer may be an NF (e.g. NEF, AF, PCF).  \nThe consumer of these analytics may indicate in the request or\nsubscription the following parameters, its content is described in the\nclause6.1.3:  \n\\- Analytics ID = \\\"User Data Congestion\\\".  \n\\- Target of Analytics Reporting: either a single UE (SUPI), or \\\"any\nUE\\\".\n\nQuestion: What does the NWDAF collect from the UPF or the AF related to user data congestion analytics?

        "question": "How are QoS flows mapped to DRBs in the uplink? [3GPP Release 18]",
        "answer": "option 3: Both reflective mapping and explicit configuration",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nFlows with Data Radio Bearers (DRB).  \nFigure 11.1-1: QoS architecture in NR and NextGen Core  \nNextGen Core and RAN ensure quality of service (e.g. reliability and\ntarget delay) by mapping packets to appropriate QoS Flows and DRBs.\nHence there is a 2-step mapping of IP-flows to QoS flows (NAS) and from\nQoS flows to DRBs (Access Stratum).  \nIn NR, the data radio bearer (DRB) defines the packet treatment on the\nradio interface (Uu).  \nA DRB serves packets with the same packet forwarding treatment. Separate\nDRBs may be established for QoS flows requiring different packet\nforwarding treatment.  \nIn the downlink, the RAN maps QoS Flows to DRBs based on NG3 marking\n(QoS Flow ID) and the associated QoS profiles.  \nIn the uplink, the UE marks uplink packets over Uu with the QoS flow ID\nfor the purposes of marking forwarded packets to the CN.  \nIn the uplink, the RAN may control the mapping of QoS Flows to DRB in\ntwo different ways:  \n\\- Reflective mapping: for each DRB, the UE monitors the QoS flow ID(s)\nof the downlink packets and applies the same mapping in the uplink; that\nis, for a DRB, the UE maps the uplink packets belonging to the QoS\nflows(s) corresponding to the QoS flow ID(s) and PDU Session observed in\nthe downlink packets for that DRB. To enable this reflective mapping,\nthe RAN marks downlink packets over Uu with QoS flow ID.  \n\\- Explicit Configuration: besides the reflective mapping, the RAN may\nconfigure by RRC an uplink \"QoS Flow to DRB mapping\".  \nIf an incoming UL packet matches neither an RRC configured nor a\nreflective \"QoS Flow ID to DRB mapping\", the UE shall map that packet to\nthe default DRB of the PDU session.  \nWithin each PDU session, is up to RAN how to map multiple QoS flows to a\nDRB. The RAN may map a GBR flow and a non-GBR flow, or more than one GBR\nflow to the same DRB, but mechanisms to optimise these cases are not\nwithin the scope of standardization. The timing of establishing\n\nInformation 2:\nseveral QoS Flows **belonging to the same PDU session** can be\nmultiplexed in the same DRB.  \nIn the uplink, the mapping of QoS Flows to DRBs is controlled by mapping\nrules which are signalled in two different ways:  \n\\- Reflective mapping: for each DRB, the UE monitors the QFI(s) of the\ndownlink packets and applies the same mapping in the uplink; that is,\nfor a DRB, the UE maps the uplink packets belonging to the QoS flows(s)\ncorresponding to the QFI(s) and PDU Session observed in the downlink\npackets for that DRB. To enable this reflective mapping, the NG-RAN\nmarks downlink packets over Uu with QFI.  \n\\- Explicit Configuration: QoS flow to DRB mapping rules can be\nexplicitly signalled by RRC.  \nThe UE always applies the latest update of the mapping rules regardless\nof whether it is performed via reflecting mapping or explicit\nconfiguration.  \nWhen a QoS flow to DRB mapping rule is updated, the UE sends an end\nmarker on the old bearer.  \nIn the downlink, the QFI is signalled by NG-RAN over Uu for the purpose\nof RQoS and if neither NG-RAN, nor the NAS (as indicated by the RQA)\nintend to use reflective mapping for the QoS flow(s) carried in a DRB,\nno QFI is signalled for that DRB over Uu. In the uplink, NG-RAN can\nconfigure the UE to signal QFI over Uu.  \nFor each PDU session, a default DRB may be configured: if an incoming UL\npacket matches neither an RRC configured nor a reflective mapping rule,\nthe UE then maps that packet to the default DRB of the PDU session. For\nnon-GBR QoS flows, the 5GC may send to the NG-RAN the Additional QoS\nFlow Information parameter associated with certain QoS flows to indicate\nthat traffic is likely to appear more often on them compared to other\nnon-GBR QoS flows established on the same PDU session.  \nWithin each PDU session, it is up to NG-RAN how to map multiple QoS\nflows to a DRB. The NG-RAN may map a GBR flow and a non-GBR flow, or\nmore than one GBR flow to the same DRB, but mechanisms to optimise these\n\nInformation 3:\nmapped to an existing DRB. The decision on how to map QoS flows into new\nor existing DRBs is taken at the CU-CP. CU-CP also defines one set of\nQoS parameters (one 5QI) for the DRB. If a QoS flow is mapped to an\nexisting DRB, the packets belonging to that QoS flow are not treated\nwith the 5QI of the QoS flow, but they are treated with the mapped 5QI\nof the DRB.  \nThe release of the DRB needs to be monitored, so that abnormal releases\nwhile the UE is considered in an active transfer shall be logged. DRB\nretainability is a key performance indicator of how often an end-user\nabnormally loses a DRB during the time the DRB is actively used. This\nkey performance indicator is of great important to estimate the end\nusers' experiences. DRBs with bursty flow are considered active if any\ndata (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms. DRBs with\ncontinuous flow are seen as active DRBs in the context of this\nmeasurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state. A particular\nDRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped 5QI is any of\n{1, 2, 65, 66}.  \nThe key performance indicator shall monitor the DRB retainability for\neach used mapped 5QI value, as well as for the used S-NSSAI(s). DRBs\nused in 3GPP option 3 shall not be covered by this KPI. For the case\nwhen a DRB have multiple QoS flows mapped and active, when a QoS flow is\nreleased it will not be counted as a DRB release (DRB still active) in\nthis KPI.  \nA.12 Use case for PDU session establishment success rate of one network slice (S-NSSAI) related KPI\n===================================================================================================  \nIt is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by 5GS.\nPDU session Establishment for a UE is important when it has registered\nto the network slice.

UE identifies the QFI and RDI in the received DL packet and the DRB\non which the packet was received. The AS mapping rules are then updated\naccordingly.  \n5\\.

In this example, the gNB receives\nfrom UPF a first downlink packet associated with a QFI, for which the\nQoS parameters are already known from the PDU session establishment, but\nfor which there is no association to any DRB yet in AS.  \nFigure A.3-1: DL data with new QFI sent over existing DRB  \n0\\.

Network slicing supports the flexible use of\nnetwork resources so that multiple networks customized to the needs of\neach set of applications can be provided simultaneously over the network\nresources while ensuring resource isolation and meeting different SLAs.\nAs more diverse industries start to use the capabilities provided by 5G\nsystem and various new services are implemented over the 5G system, the\nexpected service requirements on the 5G system vary. To meet these\ndiverse requirements on the network, the use of network slices will\nincrease further as 5G system deployments are expanded.  \nWhen configuring network slices within its network, each network\noperator may consider various factors, such as required QoS of the\napplications supported over the network slices, the amount of required\nnetwork resources to support the applications, the expected geographical\nand time boundary where the network slice services need to be provided,\nthe usable and deployed network resources at the location where the\napplications are used, the number of users, the type of devices (e.g.,\nIIoT), etc. After considering these factors, a network operator may\nprovide a network slice for different services to users. Similarly, 3rd\nparties may be authorized by the network operator to configure their own\nnetwork slices based on these various criteria, within the bounds of an\nSLA with the network operator.  \nHowever, the provisioning of network slices can be complicated, such as\nwhen a UE requests the simultaneous use of multiple network slices where\n\nQuestion: What does NSA stand for in the context of 5G architecture?

Note that the traffic descriptors in the\nURSP rules may need to be updated, e.g. based on AF Application guidance\nfor URSP determination, resulting that the updated URSP rules might not\nbe immediately enforced for some ongoing traffic.  \nTable 6.41.2-1: Example URSP rules to restrict EC traffic to 3GPP access\nin the Session Breakout model\n\nInformation 3:\nURSP or UE local configuration does not mandate that the PDU session is\nestablished over a single access, the UE can initiate the UE-requested\nPDU session establishment procedure to request an MA PDU session (see\nclause5.2.1) or to allow the PDU session to be upgraded to an MA PDU\nsession (see clause5.2.6) when transferring the PDN connection to 5GS.  \n4.7 MA PDU session establishment with 3GPP access connected to EPC and non-3GPP access connected to 5GCN\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nA UE can establish an MA PDU session via non-3GPP access connected to\n5GCN and E-UTRAN EPC as specified in clause4.22.2.3 of 3GPPTS23.502\n\\[3\\].  \nWhen establishing a PDN connection via 3GPP access connected to EPS, the\nUE can indicate that the PDN connection is to be used as a user-plane\nresource associated with:  \na\\) a new MA PDU session; or  \nb\\) an existing MA PDU session established in non-3GPP access connected\nto 5GCN.  \nNOTE: \\\"Non-3GPP access\\\" is replaced with \\\"wireline access network\\\"\nconnected to 5GCN if the UE is the 5G-RG.  \nIf the UE does not support Ethernet PDN type or the Ethernet PDN type is\nnot supported in EPC, there are following requirements:  \na\\) the UE cannot establish a PDN connection as the user plane resource\nassociated with a new MA PDU session of Ethernet PDU session type; and  \nb\\) the UE can establish a PDN connection of non-IP PDN type as the user\nplane resource associated with an existing MA PDU session of Ethernet\nPDU session type.  \nClause 5.3 specifies the procedure of MA PDU session establishment with\n3GPP access connected to EPC and non-3GPP access connected to 5GCN.  \n5 ATSSS control procedures\n==========================  \n5.1 Introduction\n----------------  \nThe ATSSS control procedures include:  \na\\) multi-access PDU connectivity service procedures (see clause5.2);  \nb\\) multi-access PDU connectivity over E-UTRAN and non-3GPP access\nnetwork (see clause5.3); and\n\nInformation 4:\n|                      |                      | 3GPP access.

For this \\'redial\\' solution to function effectively, the user\nand operator needs to configure supplementary services and network\nfeatures (such as ODB and Roaming Restrictions) in a sensible manner\n(e.g. avoid barring voice calls but permit video calls). Sensible\nconfigurations do not seem to be prohibited by the standard.  \nIt is worth noting that some supplementary services cannot be used while\nin the video component of a call (e.g. Call Hold; Multiparty; Explicit\nCall Transfer and Calling Name Presentation).  \n5.2 Calling Line Identity and Single Numbering Scheme\n-----------------------------------------------------  \nTo make this feature work smoothly, CLIs should not be restricted by the\nuser, and, CLIs should be transferred by the networks. In addition,\nsingle numbering schemes should be used (i.e. the user\\'s videophone and\ntelephone numbers need to be the same).  \nWhen detecting that a redialled call is the same as the original, the\nterminating UE should be aware that the number format might change from,\nfor example, national to international format. This could be because the\nnetworks route the voice and video calls differently, or, because the\nterminating UE was the original A party.  \nThe impacts of CAMEL based number translation services, e.g. for office\nVPNs are for further study.  \n5.3 CAMEL based services triggered by call release and CCBS\n\nQuestion: Which basic requirements shall be supported for CS multimedia calls?

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 7.1.5 Potential impacts or interactions with existing services/features  \nMPS for an MMTEL video call involves providing priority to a normal\nsubscription-based video service offered by a MPS capable network.  \nCapability to differentiate the priority between the audio and video\nstreams of a given communication session is needed, so that in times of\nresource limitation, the 3GPP system can admit / continue to support the\naudio stream, and not admit / drop the video stream, except in cases\nwhen the audio and media are not encoded as separate synchronized\nstreams. The 3GPP system can readmit the video stream when resource\nbecomes available.  \nWhen MPS is activated for an MMTEL video call, special QoS is provided\nto the bearers, which needs to:  \n-   Prioritize the allocation of PLMN resources for the signalling, and\n> the video and audio streams,  \n-   Prioritize packet transport and routing, and  \n-   Communicate priority to non-3GPP-specified nodes, e.g., IP routers.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 5.5.1 Description  \nThis use case involves MPS activation for all participants (i.e.,\nparticipants with MPS subscribed UEs and public UEs) of an MMTEL voice\nconference call initiated by the conference host (i.e., MPS Service\nUser). The MMTEL voice conference host (i.e., MPS Service User) invokes\nMPS to request priority for all participants of an MMTEL voice\nconference call when the MPS Service User is aware that normal voice\nconference service is degraded (e.g., the normal MMTEL voice conference\ncall cannot be established), or when an ongoing MMTEL voice conference\ncall becomes unacceptable for any conference participant (e.g., due to\nnetwork congestion), the MPS Service User invokes MPS to upgrade the\nentire MMTEL voice conference call to obtain priority treatment for all\nparticipants.  \nWhen the conference host (i.e., MPS Service User) cannot gain access to\nthe MMTEL voice conference server, MPS for MMTEL voice described in\nclause 5.4 may be used by the host to obtain priority access to the\nconference server or in the case of a multimedia conference, MPS for DTS\nas described in clause 6.1 may be used to obtain priority data access to\nthe conference server.  \nThe invocation of MPS for all participants of an MMTEL voice conference\ncall is done using a customized feature of the voice conference service\n(available only to the host) that indicates a request for priority to\nthe MPS capable 3GPP system.  \nThe MPS Service Provider PLMN authenticates and authorizes the MPS\nsubscriber's use of MPS conference invocation to apply to all\nparticipants of the MMTEL voice conference call.  \nPriority treatment is provided for the signalling and once MPS is\nestablished for all participants of the MMTEL voice conference call,\npriority treatment is provided for the audio media flows of all\nparticipants on the MMTEL voice conference call.  \nNOTE 1: The difference between this use case and the basic use case of\nMPS MMTEL voice conference is that in this case, MPS is invoked by a\n\nInformation 3:\n### 4.1.1 MPS for voice  \nThe primary purpose of MPS for Voice is to provide the Service User with\npriority voice communication sessions in periods of severe network\ncongestion during which normal commercial voice service is degraded. MPS\nfor Voice provides priority for MMTEL voice and MMTEL voice\nteleconferencing sessions.  \nIn most scenarios during a National Security / Emergency Preparedness\n(NS/EP) condition, it is expected that MPS for Voice is activated in\nresponse to service degradation or when the Service User is aware of\nnetwork congestion. In limited situations, e.g., when in an area with\nnetwork congestion, it is possible to proactively invoke MPS for Voice.\nIn all cases, basic connectivity is required in advance of priority\nservice invocation, and special consideration needs to be provided to\npermit service invocation messages to be delivered during times of\ncongestion.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 7.6.1 Description  \nA MPS Service User is the host (i.e., conference organizer) of an MMTEL\nvideo conference call. While connectivity continues, video quality\nbecomes unacceptable. The MPS Service User invokes MPS (i.e., via the\nvideo conference server application) to upgrade the entire MMTEL video\nconference call to obtain priority treatment for all participants (i.e.,\nparticipants with MPS subscribed UEs and public UEs) on the video\nconference call. In the case that the meeting host cannot establish the\nMMTEL video conference call, MPS for an MMTEL video call as described in\nclause 7.4 may be invoked to provide priority service for the host to\nthe conference server. In such a case, upon establishing connectivity\nwith the conference server, the host may elect to pre-emptively request\nMPS for all participants assuming that others will experience similar\nservice degradations, rather than to wait until problems with the MMTEL\nconference call are observed.  \nThe invocation of MPS for all participants on the MMTEL video conference\ncall is done using a customized feature of the video conference service\n(available only to the host) that indicates a request for priority to\nthe MPS capable 3GPP system.  \nThe MPS Service Provider PLMN authenticates and authorizes the MPS\nsubscriber's use of MPS for all participants of the MMTEL video\nconference call.  \nPriority treatment is provided for the signalling and once MPS is\nestablished for all participants of the MMTEL video conference call,\npriority treatment is provided for the audio and video media flows of\nall participants on the MMTEL video conference call.  \nNOTE 1: The difference between this use case and the basic use case of\nMPS MMTEL video conference is that in this case, MPS is invoked by a\ncustomized feature of the video conference service for all participants.\nThis use case assumes that the host was able to join the call, which may\nrequire an independent invocation of MPS for a video call, which\n\nInformation 5:\n### 5.3.5 Potential impacts or interactions with existing services/features  \nMPS for an MMTEL voice call involves providing priority to a normal\nsubscription-based voice service offered by a MPS capable network.  \nWhen MPS is invoked for an MMTEL voice call, special QoS is provided to\nthe bearers, which needs to:  \n-   Prioritize the allocation of PLMN resources for the signalling, and\n> the audio streams for the MPS call,  \n-   Prioritize packet transport and routing for the MPS call, and  \n-   Communicate priority to non-3GPP-specified nodes, e.g., IP routers.  \nThe charging aspects associated with this use case are that normal\ncharging for the call will be associated with the UE subscription\naccount while the MPS charges will be associated with the MPS Service\nUser subscription account.\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of MPS for MMTEL voice? [3GPP Release 18]\nOptions:\noption 1: To provide priority access to enterprise networks in periods of severe network congestion\noption 2: To provide priority video communication sessions in periods of severe network congestion\noption 3: To provide priority data transport service in periods of severe network congestion\noption 4: To provide priority voice communication sessions in periods of severe network congestion\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: To provide priority voice communication sessions in periods of severe network congestion\n"

E.g., UE relative\nto another moving UE outside of coverage.  \n\\- When absolute positions are not required, and the effort of defining\na fixed coordinate system can be avoided; e.g. distance between two UEs\nor speed of a specific UE can be derived from relative positions.  \nBeside the differentiation between absolute and relative positioning, it\nis important to notice, that distances are not positions, but can be\nderived from absolute as well as relative positions. Likewise, velocity\ncan be derived from a time series of absolute or relative positions, but\nalso from a time series of distances. Methods like sidelink ranging\n(possibly introduced with Release 17) could be used to measure distances\nand velocity directly, while bypassing positioning.  \nConsidering multi-hop distance measurements or positioning, additional\nerror sources occur from:  \n\\- relative movement between units and depends on the velocity of the\nmovement,  \n\\- deployment of the UEs (geometrical dilution of precision),  \n\\- surveying error of UEs taking part in the measurement process.  \nDue to those additional errors, multi-hop relative positioning\n(especially for dynamic scenarios) may not be able to provide required\naccuracy.  \nOverview of relative positioning mentioned in technical specifications\n(TS):  \nWhen providing a Location Estimate, the LCS Server may provide the\nvertical location of an UE in terms of either absolute height/depth or\nrelative height/depth to local ground level (TS 22.071).  \nThe vertical location of the UE shall be expressed in terms defined by\nlocal regulatory requirements which may include absolute height/depth or\nrelative height/depth to ground level (TS 22.071).  \nThe 3GPP system shall support relative lateral position accuracy of 0.1\nm between UEs supporting V2X application (TS 22.186).\n\nInformation 5:\n\\[26\\] 3GPP TS 38.901 Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to\n100 GHz (Release 16)  \n\\[27\\] 3GPP TS 38.305: \\\"NG Radio Access Network (NG-RAN); Stage 2\nfunctional specification of User Equipment (UE) positioning in NG-RAN\\\".  \n\\[28\\] EGNOS Open Service (OS) Service Definition Document, European\nCommission, Version 2.3, 2017.  \n\\[29\\] 3GPP TS 24.571 Control plane Location Services (LCS) procedures\n(Release 16)  \n\\[30\\] 3GPP TR 22.872: \\\"Study on positioning use cases\\\".  \n\\[31\\] R2-2006541, TP for Study on Positioning Integrity and\nReliability, Swift Navigation, Deutsche Telekom, u-blox, Ericsson,\nMitsubishi Electric, Intel Corporation, CATT, UIC.  \n\\[32\\] Zhu, N., Marais, J., Betaille, D., Berbineau, M., \\\"GNSS Position\nIntegrity in Urban Environments: A Review of Literature\\\", IEEE\nTransactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Vol. 19, No. 9, Sep\n2018.  \n\\[33\\] European Space Agency, \\\"Integrity\\\", Navipedia, 2018,\n\\<https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Integrity\\>.  \n\\[34\\] Reid, T., Houts, S., Cammarata, R., Mills, G., Agarwal, S., Vora,\nA., Pandey, G., \\\"Localization Requirements for Autonomous Vehicles,\\\"\nSAE International Journal of Connected and Automated Vehicles, Vol. 2,\nNo. 3, pp. 173--190, Sep 2019.  \n\\[35\\] GSA-MKD-RD-UREQ-250283, \\\"Report on Road User Needs and\nRequirements: Outcome of the European GNSS\\' User Consultation\nPlatform\\\", Issue/Rev: 2.0, 2019.  \n\\[36\\] GSA-MKD-RL-UREQ-250286, \\\"Report on Rail User Needs and\nRequirements: Outcome of the European GNSS\\' User Consultation\nPlatform\\\", Issue/Rev: 2.0, 2019.  \n\\[37\\] 5GAA, \\\"White Paper -- C-V2X Use Cases Methodology, Examples and\nService Level Requirements, 2019.  \n\\[38\\] Global Positioning System Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)\nPerformance Standard, Department of Transportation USA, Federal Aviation\nAuthority, Edition 1, October 2008.  \n\\[39\\] International Civil Aviation Organization, \\\"Annex 10 to the\nConvention on International Civil Aviation, Aeronautical\n\nQuestion: Which error sources are studied for timing-based positioning methods?

The SMF assigns a new N4\nSession ID and provides it to the UPF. The N4 Session ID is stored by\nboth entities and used to identify the N4 session context during their\ninteraction. The SMF also stores the relation between the N4 Session ID\nand PDU Session for a UE.  \nFigure 4.4.1.2-1 N4 Session Establishment procedure  \n1\\. SMF receives the trigger to establish a new PDU Session or change\nthe UPF for an established PDU Session.  \n2\\. The SMF sends an N4 session establishment request message to the UPF\nthat contains the structured control information which defines how the\nUPF needs to behave.  \n3\\. The UPF responds with an N4 session establishment response message\ncontaining any information that the UPF has to provide to the SMF in\nresponse to the control information received.  \nIf the UPF (by configuration or other means) utilizes an NWDAF, UPF adds\nthe NWDAF serving the UE identified by the NWDAF instance ID. Per NWDAF\nservice instance the Analytics ID(s) are also included.  \nNOTE: The SMF can use this NWDAF related information and can forward it\nto the PCF using the SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure, as\na result of a Policy Control Request Trigger.  \n4\\.

The SMF interacts with the network function which triggered this\nprocedure (e.g. AMF or PCF).  \n#### 4.4.1.3 N4 Session Modification procedure\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.33.1 Functional Description  \n#### 6.33.1.1 System Architecture  \nBaseline architectures Architecture 1 contains an MSF-U controlled by an\nMSF-C, and architecture 2 contains a MBSU controlled by an MBSF for\nsimilar tasks; the MBSF is integrated into the NEF. The converged\narchitecture also contains an MBSF-U controlled by an MBSF-C. It is\nexpected that proposed solution can be applied to baseline architecture\n1, baseline architecture 2, and the converged architecture.  \nThe terms CP function and UP function will be used in what follows. A CP\nfunction that could be MSF-C, NEF, or MBSF-C, and a UP function that\ncould be a MSF-U or MBSF-U.  \nEditor\\'s note: It is FFS if N4 interface as specified in\nTS29.244\\[17\\] is suitable for the interaction between MSF-C and\nMSF-U. Collaboration with SAWG4 is needed.  \n#### 6.33.1.1 High Level Proposal  \nThe procedures between UP function and CP function will be an based on\nextension on N4 session management parameters in clause5.8.2.11 of\nTS23.501\\[2\\]. N4 session management is used successfully in the 3GPP\necosystem and provides capabilities e.g. for packet filtering,\nforwarding, repacketization of PDUs (i.e. manipulation of transport\nlayer), event notifications and billing. It lacks media manipulation\ncapabilities (for transcoding, FEC and ROHC) and will require related\nextensions; solution 33 contains proposals for such extensions.  \nThis has the advantage that N4 session management is well known in the\n3GPP ecosystem and that implementations collocating the UPF (that is\nalready controlled using N4 session management) and the MBSU/MSF-U to\nminimize the user plane processing resources could also become possible\nin that manner.  \n#### 6.33.1.2 Requirements  \nThe UP function will need to support transcoding, Forward Error\nCorrection (FEC), and Robust Header Corrections (ROHC). It will also\nneed to support receiving data via HTTP streaming.  \nFor FEC, two outgoing streams are created for one incoming stream: a\n\nInformation 5:\nprocedure (e.g. AMF or PCF).  \n#### 4.4.1.3 N4 Session Modification procedure  \nThe N4 Session Modification procedure is used to update the N4 session\ncontext of an existing PDU Session at the UPF, which is executed between\nSMF and UPF whenever PDU Session related parameters have to be modified.  \nFigure 4.4.1.3-1 N4 Session Modification procedure  \n1\\. SMF receives the trigger to modify the existing PDU Session.  \n2\\. The SMF sends an N4 session modification request message to the UPF\nthat contains the update for the structured control information which\ndefines how the UPF needs to behave.  \n3\\. The UPF identifies the N4 session context to be modified by the N4\nSession ID. Then, the UPF updates the parameters of this N4 session\ncontext according to the list of parameters sent by the SMF. The UPF\nresponds with an N4 session modification response message containing any\ninformation that the UPF has to provide to the SMF in response to the\ncontrol information received.  \n4\\. The SMF interacts with the network entity which triggered this\nprocedure (e.g. AMF or PCF).  \n#### 4.4.1.4 N4 Session Release procedure  \nThe N4 session release procedure is used to remove the N4 session\ncontext of an existing PDU Session at the UPF.  \nFigure 4.4.1.4-1 N4 Session Release procedure  \n1\\. SMF receives the trigger to remove the N4 session context for the\nPDU Session.  \n2\\. The SMF sends an N4 session release request message to the UPF.  \n3\\. The UPF identifies the N4 session context to be removed by the N4\nSession ID and removes the whole session context. The UPF responds with\nan N4 session release response message containing any information that\nthe UPF has to provide to the SMF.  \n4\\. The SMF interacts with the network entity which triggered this\nprocedure (e.g. AMF or PCF).\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of N4 session management procedures?

General  \n5GS interworking procedures with EPC rely on selecting a combined\nPGW-C/SMF and PGW-U/UPF during the PDN connection establishment (see\nclause4.11 of 3GPPTS23.501\\[28\\]).  \n#### 5.12.3.2 PGW-C/SMF selection  \nAn MME and an ePDG shall select a combined PGW-C/SMF for PDN connections\nthat may be subject to mobility to 5GS, e.g. for UEs supporting N1 mode\nand not restricted to interworking with 5GS by user subscription (see\n\\\"5GC\\\" bit within Core-Network-Restrictions AVP and\nInterworking-5GS-Indicator AVP specified in 3GPPTS29.272\\[27\\] and\n3GPPTS29.273\\[30\\]). A UE signals its support for 5GC NAS to the MME\nin NAS signalling and to the ePDG in IKEv2 signalling.  \nAn MME and an ePDG should also select a combined PGW-C/SMF, if possible,\nfor PDN connections of UEs not supporting N1 mode that are not\nrestricted to access the 5GC by user subscription (see \\\"5GC\\\" bit\nwithin Core-Network-Restrictions AVP and Interworking-5GS-Indicator AVP\nspecified in 3GPPTS29.272\\[27\\] and 3GPPTS29.273\\[30\\]).  \nA PDN connection of a subscription restricted from accessing the 5GC or\nwithout 5GS interworking subscribed for the APN is not subject to\nmobility to 5GS and may be connected to a PGW, a PGW-C or a combined\nPGW-C/SMF; when PGW-C (or PGW) and combined PGW-C/SMF are available for\nelection, the preference order may be based on operator\\'s policy in the\nMME or ePDG.  \nDNS procedures to select a combined PGW-C/SMF shall be supported as\nspecified in clause5.12.1, with the following additions:  \n\\- the \\<network-capability\\> shall be set to \\\"smf\\\".  \nFor example, the MME shall discover all GTP based S5/S8 interfaces using\n\\\"Service Parameters\\\" of \\\"x-3gpp-pgw:x-s5-gtp+nc-smf\\\",\n\\\"x-3gpp-pgw:x-s8-gtp+nc-smf\\\" and the ePDG shall discover all GTP based\nS2b interfaces using \\\"Service Parameters\\\" of\n\\\"x-3gpp-pgw:x-s2b-gtp+nc-smf\\\".  \n\\- this network capability may apply to:\n\nInformation 5:\n### 8.10.1 General  \nThe functional entities of the Edge Enabler Layer can utilize the 3GPP\ncore network capabilities (i.e. 5GC, EPC) to fulfill the needs of the\nedge service operations.

Although range length for\nthe DFF setup is not a requirement for permitted methods, a reference\nvalue of 0.725m is used in the TR38.810 calculations. Furthermore, the\nmaximum achievable SNR values are calculated assuming the highest band\nn259 frequency (f=43.5 GHz). The highest frequency to be considered for\nthe SNR calculation is the highest frequency of band n262: 48.2 GHz.\nUsing the reference range length of 0.725m we determine free space path\nloss at f=48.2 GHz, as shown in Figure 7.1-1 below.  \n![](media/image93.emf){width=\"4.0in\" height=\"3.000103893263342in\"}  \nFigure 7.1-1: Free space path loss vs. frequency for d=0.725m  \nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in free space path loss\nfrom 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.9 dB.  \nAnother parameter in the SNR calculation which scales with frequency is\ncable loss per meter. Using the datasheets from five different\ncommercially available RF cables, which are rated up to 50 GHz, the\naverage cable loss per meter is calculated (averaging performed in\nlinear gain units), as shown in Figure 7.1-2 below.  \n![](media/image94.emf){width=\"4.0in\" height=\"3.000103893263342in\"}  \nFigure 7.1-2: Cable loss per meter vs. frequency  \nBased on this analysis, the relative increase in cable loss per meter\nfrom 43.5 GHz to 48.2 GHz is 0.33 dB.  \nThe SNR calculation related to cable loss also includes connector losses\nand additional margin, and it is feasible to reuse these parameters for\nthe calculations related to band n262.  \nThe SNR calculation also includes two parameters which are taken from UE\nRF requirements: REFSENS and multi-band relaxation.

The NWDAF determines to collect data, either directly from the UPF\nor indirectly via the SMF and identifies the SMF(s) and/or UPF(s) to\nretrieve input data according to the S-NSSAI/DNN and SUPI or list of\nSUPIs in the analytics request.  \n3\\. The NWDAF collects input information using the procedure for\nsubscription to UPF event exposure for certain UEs via SMF as described\nin clause4.15.4.5.2 of TS23.502\\[3\\]; the Target of Event Reporting\nis set to each of the tuple (SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI) that has a PDU\nSession in the same SMF, the Target Subscription Information is set to\n\\\"UserDataUsageMeasures\\\", the Target service data flows is absent to\nindicate that the UPF reports any detected service data flow in the PDU\nSession.  \nThe UPF reports volume measurements for the PDU Session with per\napplication granularity, the report includes volume measurements and\nprovide the application related information, i.e. URLs and Domain names.  \n4\\. The NWDAF derives analytics indicating a list of UEs and the traffic\nthey route according to the provided information provided by the\nconsumer (i.e. Traffic Descriptor, S-NSSAI and DNN), including its\nvolume and the traffic they route and a list of UEs which route traffic\nthat it is not expected according to the information provided by the\nconsumer (i.e. Traffic Descriptor, S-NSSAI and DNN) including its\nvolume.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.20.1 General  \nThis clause specifies the procedure for an NWDAF to provide statistics\non whether traffic of UEs via one or multiple PDU sessions is according\nto the information provide by the service consumer.  \nThe NWDAF collects traffic flow information of UE traffic via PDU\nsession(s) established for a specific S-NSSAI and/or DNN and provides\nstatistics of UEs that route traffic according to the information\nprovided by the service consumer (e.g., Traffic Descriptor, S-NSSAI,\nDNN) and UEs that route traffic which is not expected according to the\ninformation provided by the service consumer (e.g., Traffic Descriptor,\nS-NSSAI, DNN).  \nThe assumption is that Traffic Descriptors are known (e.g. known flow\ndescription), so that there are associated Packet Detection Rule(s) for\nthe known traffic configured in the UPF.  \nNOTE1: How traffic from different applications over the same\nS-NSSAI/DNN and/or PDU session is discerned is implementation-specific.  \nThe service consumer may be a PCF.  \nThe consumer of these analytics includes in the request:  \n\\- Analytics ID = \\\"PDU Session traffic\\\".  \n\\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a SUPI or a list of SUPIs or an\nInternal-Group-Id or any UE.  \n\\- Traffic Descriptor: Application Identifier, IP Descriptions or Domain\nDescriptors are applicable.  \nNOTE2: The Application Id provided by the consumer is known by the\nnetwork, i.e. corresponds to an Application Id known at the UPF.  \n\\- Analytics Filter Information containing:  \n\\- Area of Interest (i.e. the location of UEs where PDU Session traffic\nis monitored);  \n\\- S-NSSAI;  \n\\- DNN;  \n\\- an optional list of analytics subsets that are requested (see\nclause6.20.3);  \n\\- Optionally, preferred level of accuracy of the analytics.  \n\\- Optionally, preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset (see\nclause6.20.3);  \n\\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the\nanalytics are requested.  \n\\- Optionally, maximum number of objects.\n\nInformation 5:\nservice to collect data on the number of PDU sessions established and/or\nreleased at the SMF on currently registered on certain Network Slice as\ndefined in clause6.3.2A. NWDAF can then use such collected data to\ndetermine the number of PDU sessions established on i) a Network Slice;\nand ii) if available, on a Network Slice instance by leveraging the data\ncollected in step5.  \n7\\. \\[CONDITIONAL\\] The NWDAF may subscribe to one or multiple NSACFs to\ncollect data on either the number of UE registered in a S-NSSAI or the\nnumber of PDU sessions established in a S-NSSAI as defined in\nclause6.3.2A. When multiple NSACFs are selected by the NWDAF for the\nS-NSSAI, the NWDAF aggregates the reports from the NSACFs to derive the\nnumber of UEs registered in the S-NSSAI or the number of PDU sessions\nestablished in the S-NSSAI.  \n8\\. The NWDAF derives slice load analytics.  \n9\\. The NWDAF delivers analytics to the consumer NF by invoking\nNnwdaf\\_AnalyticsSubscription\\_Notify or Nnwdaf\\_AnalyticsInfo\\_Request\nresponse service operations.  \n6.4 Observed Service Experience related network data analytics\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: In the NWDAF providing PDU Session traffic analytics, who requests or subscribes to the NWDAF? [3GPP Release 18]\nOptions:\noption 1: ULF\noption 2: SMF\noption 3: PCF\noption 4: UPF\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 3: PCF\n"
