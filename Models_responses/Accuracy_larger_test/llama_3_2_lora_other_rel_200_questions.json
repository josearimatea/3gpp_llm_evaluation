The larger tolerance in\nthe coordinated movements allows for either faster movement of the work\npiece or longer transfer intervals (tradeoff between UE speed and\ntransfer interval). A longer transfer interval relaxes the requirement\non the maximum end-to-end latency.  \nThe values given in Table 6.4-1 for use case \\\"cooperative carrying\\\"\nare the upper boundary of the required KPIs. There is a broad variety in\nthe actual use cases of cooperative carrying and several parameters and\ndeployment options have some flexibility in their value range or\nimplementation. Relaxed KPI requirements can already satisfy a\nsubstantial set of cooperative carrying use cases depending on the\nactual physical characteristics (e.g. carrying speed, type of carried\nwork piece).  \nThe actual physical use case setting, such as the kind of workpiece to\nbe carried, determines the necessary requirements on the communication\nservice and the possible tradeoffs. Also the employed control algorithms\nand recovery mechanisms may further relax the necessary requirements and\nKPIs. Furthermore, the careful design of the mobile robots / AGVs (e.g.\nplacement of UEs) can further improve the reliability of the wireless\ncommunication. Tradeoffs are especially possible between the carrying\nspeed and the transfer interval / end-to-end latency as well as the\ncommunication service reliability. A reduction of the carrying speed\nreduces the requirements on the transfer interval / end-to-end latency\nor on the packet error ratio.

For many AI/ML\ntasks, the fragmented data collected by mobile devices are essential for\ntraining a global model. In the traditional approaches, the training\ndata gathered by mobile devices are centralized to the cloud datacenter\nfor a centralized training.  \nHowever, an AI/ML model training often requires a large data set and\nsignificant computational resources for multiple weight-update\niterations. Nowadays, most of the AI/ML model training tasks are\nperformed in the power cloud datacenters since the resource consumption\nof the training phase significantly overweights the inference phase. In\nmany cases, training a DNN model still takes several hours to multiple\ndays. However, cloud-based training means that the enormous amount of\ntraining data should be shipped from devices to the cloud, incurring\nprohibitive communication overhead as well as the data privacy pressure\nat the network side \\[10\\]. Similar to the split AI/ML inference\nintroduced in Annex B, AI/ML model training tasks can also work in a\ncloud-device coordination manner. Distributed Learning and Federated\nLearning are examples in this manner.  \nIn Distributed Learning mode, as shown in Figure D.1-1, each computing\nnode trains its own DNN model locally with local data, which preserves\nprivate information locally. To obtain the global DNN model by sharing\nlocal training improvement, nodes in the network will communicate with\neach other to exchange the local model updates. In this mode, the global\nDNN model can be trained without the intervention of the cloud\ndatacenter \\[10\\].  \n![](media/image50.jpeg){width=\"2.11875in\" height=\"1.6145833333333333in\"}  \nFigure D.1-1.

Many references \\[10-14\\]\nhave shown that processing AI/ML inference with device-network synergy\ncan alleviate the pressure of computation, memory footprint, storage,\npower and required data rate on devices, reduce end-to-end latency and\nenergy consumption, and improve the end-to-end accuracy and efficiency\nwhen compared to the local execution approach on either side.  \nThe scheme of split AI/ML inference can be depicted in Figure B.1-1. The\nAI/ML operation/model is split into multiple parts according to the\ncurrent task and environment. The intention is to offload the\ncomputation-intensive, energy-intensive parts to network endpoints,\nwhereas leave the privacy-sensitive and delay- sensitive parts at the\nend device. The device executes the operation/model up to a specific\npart/layer and sends the intermediate data to the network endpoint. The\nnetwork endpoint executes the remaining parts/layers and feeds the\ninference results back to the device. It should be noted that, in the\nexample in Figure B.1-1, the final inference result is output by network\nAI/ML endpoint 2. According to actual use case, the inference result can\nalso be output by other endpoints, e.g. network AI/ML endpoint 1.  \n![](media/image40.jpeg){width=\"6.286111111111111in\"\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.1.1 Description  \nThe AI/ML-based mobile applications are increasingly\ncomputation-intensive, memory-consuming and power-consuming. Meanwhile\nend devices usually have stringent energy consumption, compute and\nmemory limitations for running a complete offline AI/ML inference\non-board. Many AI/ML applications, e.g. image recognition, currently\nintent to offload the inference processing from mobile devices to\ninternet datacenters (IDC). For example, photos shot by a smartphone are\noften processed in a cloud AI/ML server before shown to the user who\nshot them. However, the cloud-based AI/ML inference tasks need to take\ninto account the computation pressure at IDCs, required data\nrate/latency and privacy protection requirement.  \nImage and video are the biggest data on today's Internet. Videos account\nfor over 70% of daily Internet traffic \\[4\\]. Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) models have be widely used for image/video recognition\ntasks on mobile devices, e.g. image classification, image segmentation,\nobject localization and detection, face authentication, action\nrecognition, enhanced photography, VR/AR, video games. Meanwhile, CNN\nmodel inference requires an intensive computation and storage resource.\nFor example, AlexNet \\[7\\], VGG-16 \\[8\\] and GoogleNet \\[9\\] require\n724M, 15.5G and 1.43G MACs (multiply-add computation) respectively for a\ntypical image classification task.  \nMany references \\[10-14\\] have shown that AI/ML inference for image\nprocessing with device-network synergy can alleviate the pressure of\ncomputation, memory footprint, storage, power and required data rate on\ndevices, reduce end-to-end latency and energy consumption, and improve\nthe end-to-end accuracy, efficiency and privacy when compared to the\nlocal execution approach on either side.

Since it is believed\nthat the main computational elements a human brain are 86 billion\nneurons, the two subareas of brain-inspired computation are both\ninspired by the architecture of a neuron \\[25\\], as shown in figure\nA.2-1 (a).  \nCompared to spiking computing approaches, e.g. \\[3\\], the more popular\nML approaches are using ***\"neural network\"*** as the model. Neural\nnetworks (NN) take their inspiration from the notion that a neuron's\ncomputation involves a weighted sum of the input values. But instead of\nsimply outputting the weighted sum, a NN applies a nonlinear function to\ngenerate an output only if the inputs cross some threshold, as shown in\nfigure A.2-1(a).

Hence more efficient compute engines are often used, e.g.\ngraphics processing units (GPU) and network processing units (NPU).\nCompared to the inference which only involves the feedforward process,\nthe training often requires more computation and storage resources\nbecause it involves also the backpropagation process \\[10\\].  \nA.4 Widely-used DNN models and algorithms\n-----------------------------------------  \nMany DNN models have been developed over the past two decades.

It\ncontains three data sets: DGPS correction, ephemeris and clock\ncorrection, almanac and other data information. The empheris, clock\ncorrection, almanac and other data are obtained from GPS navigation\nmessage. It is built so that it fits into a fixed length message not\nnecessarily occupying the whole message. In case that the fixed length\nmessage has less information elements than bits available then the rest\nof message is filled with fill bits.  \nThis message is built to allow for broadcast rates that more closely\nmatch the time of applicability of the contained data.  \nEXAMPLE: With a 30 s rate for DGPS broadcast, mobile staion (MS) can\neffectively remove degration caused by SA.  \nGPS subframes 1 through 3 (ephemeris and clock correction data) are\ncontained in the same single broadcast message. With a 90 s rate, Mobile\nStations (MS) can receive all visible ephemeris and clock correction\ndata at twelve to eighteen minute intervals depending on number of\nvisible satellites. Subframes 4 and 5 (almanac, ionospheric delay, and\nother more slowly changing data can be sent at another rate, such as\nonce every several hours. By splitting the data into separate data sets\n(all based on the same single format), the data can be sent at rates\nthat are correspond to its validity time and/or the desire to update the\nmobile stations within its network at a particular rate.

Some location services may not require\nboth, others may require both, but with different degrees of accuracy.  \nGiven that the location estimate is the best possible within the bounds\nof required response time, the location estimates of a fixed position UE\n(assuming several estimates are made) will reveal a'spread' of\nestimates around the actual UE position. The distribution of locations\ncan be described by normal statistical parameters and suggests that a\nsmall proportion of location estimates may lie outside of the acceptable\nQuality of Service (QoS) parameters for specific services (as determined\nby the network operator).  \nIt may be possible to provide information on the confidence that can be\nassociated with a location estimate. This may be used by location\nservices to decide if a position update should be requested, for\nexample, if the reported accuracy falls below a threshold determined by\nthe LCS Client or Network Operator for a specific service.  \nIt may also be possible to determine velocity (speed and heading)\ninformation from a location request.  \nWhen delivered with a location estimate, the confidence region\nparameters, speed and heading may allow an application to improve the\nservice delivered to the UE user. Some examples are given below:  \na\\) Confidence Region: Simple measure of uncertainty that specifies the\nsize and orientation of the ellipse in which an UE is likely to lie with\na predetermined confidence (e.g. 67%). The size of the confidence region\nmay be used by the network operator or the LCS Client to request an\nupdated location estimate.  \nb\\) Speed: enables e.g. congestion monitoring, and average travel time\nestimates between locations.  \nc\\) Heading: the location estimate of a vehicle may be improved to\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.59.1 Functional Description  \n#### 6.59.1.1 General  \nThis solution addresses the KI \\\"Key Issue \\#9: Enhancement of NWDAF\nwith finer granularity of location information\\\".  \nEditor\\'s note: This paper is only focused on NWDAF enhancement.

LMF as a\nconsumer of such analytics uses Location Estimation Accuracy analytics\nto determine Position Method in the area where a UE is located*.  \nTS23.273\\[13\\] defines LCS QoS to have the following attributes: (1)\nLocation Accuracy, (2) Response time and (3) QoS Class. Among these, the\nQoS Class attribute gives the requirement on the other attributes like\naccuracy or response time. It could take as values Best Effort, Multiple\nQoS Class or Assured. While the Best Effort class is the least stringent\none, the other two require the LMF to determine how accurate its\nlocation estimate is.  \nFor example:  \n\\- in the case of \\\"Multiple QoS Class\\\", if the accuracy is less than\nwhat is required, the LMF selects an appropriate localization method\n(e.g. with more TRP measurements) and re-runs the location estimate in\norder to reach the required accuracy.  \n\\- in the case of \\\"Assured\\\" QoS Class, the procedure fails if the\naccuracy required is not met.  \nTo provide a real-time estimate of location accuracy without need for\nbenchmark/ground truth location, we propose a data analytics-based\nsolution running in the NWDAF with a supervised Machine Learning model\n(e.g. Neural Network).  \nA training should be first performed on the selected ML model with\nlabelled data, i.e. input data with corresponding output data:\n\nInformation 5:\n### 4.3.7 Bluetooth positioning  \nThe Bluetooth positioning method makes use of the Bluetooth measurements\n(Bluetooth beacon identifiers and optionally other measurements) and\ndatabases to determine the location of the UE.

For example, operations defined in Basic CM IRP are used\ntogether with E- UTRAN NRM IRP or UTRAN NRM IRP to support E- UTRAN or\nUTRAN configuration management functions.  \n\\- Interface IRPs are Converged Management ready (e.g. support\nmanagement of fixed and/or mobile) and can operate on modelled mobile\nand/or fixed network entities.  \n\\- A Data Definition IRP provides common data definitions, referenced by\nspecifications of Interface IRPs and NRM IRPs.  \nFigure 4.2-2: Relationship Interface IRP vs NRM IRP\n\nInformation 5:\nlocation to transmit SRS, esp. considering TDD slot format, where not\nall slots are available to transmit SRS. To address this issue, Rel-17\nintroduces SRS triggering offset enhancement based on available slot\ndefinition. Up to 4 offset values can be configured in RRC per SRS\nresource set, where each value is defined as the number of available\nslots counting from a reference slot. Reference slot is defined as the\nslot indicated by legacy triggering offset. In DCI format\n0\\_1/0\\_2/1\\_1/1\\_2, one new field \\\"SRS offset indicator\\\" (SOI) is\nadded to select one available slot offset value from the configured\nones. In addition, Rel-15/16 DCI format 0\\_1/0\\_2 cannot be indicated to\ntrigger SRS only, i.e., without CSI request and without data. This\nlimitation is removed in Rel-17 by allowing gNB to trigger SRS based on\nDCI format 0\\_1/0\\_2 without CSI request and without data.  \nTo ensure performance for uses case with larger than 4 receive antennas,\nRel-17 introduces antenna switching SRS to support 1T6R, 1T8R, 2T6R,\n2T8R and 4T8R. In addition, to improve flexibility of antenna switching\nSRS, Rel-17 extends the P/SP configurations by supporting maximum 2 SP\nSRS resource sets and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource set for antenna\nswitching, and the aperiodic configuration by supporting 1 or 4\naperiodic SRS resource sets for 1T4R and 2 aperiodic resource sets for\n1T2R/2T4R.  \nIn order to enhance the capacity and coverage for SRS, the following\nthree schemes are specified in Rel-17.  \n-   Increased repetition: Rel-17 supports 8, 10, 12 and 14 consecutive\nrepetition symbols in one slot in one SRS resource.  \n-   Partial frequency sounding: Rel-17 supports to ***transmit SRS only\nin***$\\frac{1}{P_{F}}m_{SRS,B_{\\text{SRS}}}$***contiguous RBs in\none OFDM symbol, where*** $m_{SRS,B_{\\text{SRS}}}$ ***indicates the\nnumber of RBs configured by B~SRS~and C~SRS~.

The usage of multi-carrier could be hence restricted to EGPRS.  \n#### 7.5.2.5 Incremental redundancy  \nIn order to retain full retransmission flexibility, the incremental\nredundancy (IR) within all carriers should be supported. This feature\nwould be mandatory for MS and optional for BSS.  \n#### 7.5.2.6 Link adaptation  \nLink quality measurements are reported in acknowledgement message, upon\nrequest from the network. As described in subclause 7.5.1.4, it would be\nbeneficial to report the measurements separately for all carriers. In\norder to avoid reporting a large amount of measurement data in a single\nEGPRS channel quality report, the following approach could be\nconsidered.  \nReport measurements for only one carrier in the acknowledgement message\n(i.e. report measurements for the carrier on which the poll was\nreceived). Indication of the reported carrier is needed.  \n#### 7.5.2.7 Signalling  \nThe allocation of multiple carriers needs to be supported through\nsignalling (assignment, reconfiguration of resources) between the\nnetwork and the mobile station. This will increase the likelihood for\nsegmentation of the corresponding RLC/MAC control messages. Note however\nthat extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation was introduced in\nRel-6 for messages that span over more than two radio blocks, and can be\nused in this case as well.\n\nInformation 5:\nselected to solve the problems in the 3GPP standard described by the\nwork item \"Continuous Connectivity for Packet Data Users\" defined in\n\\[1\\].  \n5.1 Overview of the selected solution\n-------------------------------------  \n\\\"Continuous connectivity for packet data users\\\" as building block\nunder the REL-7 feature \\\"RAN improvements\\\" was decided by RAN1 \\#46 to\nconsist of the following UL & DL improvements:  \n\\- A **new UL DPCCH slot format** configurable by L3 in a semi-static\nway (based on section 4.1).  \n**- UL DPCCH gating/discontinuous transmission** (DTX) in 2 cycles\n(based on section 4.2) connected with a **F-DPCH gating in DL** and an\nimplicit **CQI reporting reduction** in UL (see section 4.4)  \n\\- In DL: **Discontinuous reception** (DRX) at the UE (based on section\n4.5).  \n\\- In DL: A so called **HS-SCCH-less operation** which includes an\nHS-SCCH less initial transmission and modified HS-SCCH for\nretransmission(s) (based on section 4.8).  \nNote 1: The referenced subsections of section 4 indicate the ideas that\nwere taken into account but they do not necessarily describe the\nconcepts exactly as they were introduced in the final solution as\ndescribed in section 5.  \nNote 2: The building block \\\"Continuous connectivity for packet data\nusers\\\" under the REL-7 feature \\\"RAN improvements\\\" is in the following\nabbreviated as \\\"CPC solution\\\" (CPC: continuously packet connected or\ncontinuous packet connectivity).  \nThe following summary provides an overview about the CPC solution as\nintroduced in the REL-7 specifications (for more detailed description\nplease refer to the corresponding CRs).  \nThe CPC solution:  \n\\- is mandatory to be implemented in all FDD UEs of REL-7 and above\nsupporting HSDPA/E-DCH (even though the actual shutting off of the UE\nreceiver remains an UE implementation issue);  \n\\- is configurable on a per UE basis by the SRNC i.e. the SRNC can\nenable the CPC solution or parts of it for each UE individually provided\n\nQuestion: Which feature was introduced in Rel-15 to improve transmission reliability in Carrier Aggregation (CA) for mode-4?

Configuration variables can be used on an\nevent type by event type basis to control behaviour.  \nThe solution assumes that the MC AS can communicates directly with the\nCore Network and the Core Network can communicate directly with the RAN.  \nExamples of events impacting the functionality of mission critical\napplications include:  \n\\- pre-emption of radio bearers  \n\\- pre-emption of UEs  \n\\- congestion  \n\\- traffic shaping resulting in dropping of packets by the core network\nor RAN  \n\\- mobility events  \n\\- reports of bad RF from certain UEs, etc.  \nThe MC AS identifies the events/conditions that is interested in and\nprovides this information to the Core Network, which may forward it to\nthe RAN. The MC AS may want to have remediation or mitigation of the\nreported condition. For example, the MC AS may effect some of the UEs in\nthe cells reported to have high congestion to transition to receive data\nin idle mode in order to avoid the chance of the UEs being pre-empted.  \nThese capabilities are offered as \\\"tools in a toolbox\\\" available to\nthe MC AS, and their actual use is essentially optional.  \nThis solution is predicated on the RAN/Core Network identifying and\nreporting the relevant conditions and events.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 6.14.1 Introduction {#introduction-12}  \nThis solution is for key issue \\#3A: Exposure of deterministic QoS.  \nThe scope of this solution is to support deterministic communication to\nthe UEs operating applications. The main source of QoS related\ninformation for applications is AF, and a UE could operate multiple\napplications simultaneously. To take benefits of TSC supporting\nfeatures, Rel-16 allows the AF to provide a QoS reference that is mapped\nby the PCF into QoS parameters.  \nThe fundamental mechanism of this solution is to utilize network\nanalytics from NWDAF. NWDAF can collect network data, and able to\nprovide the analytics about Observed Service Experience as defined in\nTS23.288\\[14\\]. PCF can decide if QoS parameters fulfil the QoS\nrequirements.  \nThis solution proposes that a PCF, that responsible for deciding a PCC\nrule of deterministic communication, consumes network analytics on\nObserved Service Experience from NWDAF.\n\nInformation 3:\nForeword 7  \n1 Scope 8  \n2 References 8  \n3 Definitions and abbreviations 11  \n3.1 Definitions 11  \n3.2 Abbreviations 12  \n4 Rx reference point 13  \n4.1 Overview 13  \n4.2 Rx reference model 13  \n4.3 Functional elements 13  \n4.3.1 AF 13  \n4.3.2 PCRF 14  \n4.4 PCC procedures over Rx reference point 14  \n4.4.1 Initial Provisioning of Session Information 14  \n4.4.2 Modification of Session Information 19  \n4.4.3 Gate Related Procedures 22  \n4.4.4 AF Session Termination 23  \n4.4.5 Subscription to Notification of Signalling Path Status 23  \n4.4.5A Provisioning of AF Signalling Flow Information 24  \n4.4.6 Traffic Plane Events 25  \n4.4.6.1 IP-CAN Session Termination 25  \n4.4.6.2 Service Data Flow Deactivation and Resource Allocation Failure\n25  \n4.4.6.3 Notification of Signalling Path Status 25  \n4.4.6.4 IP-CAN type change Notification 26  \n4.4.6.5 Access Network Charging Information Notification 26  \n4.4.6.6 Reporting Usage for Sponsored Data Connectivity 26  \n4.4.6.7 Reporting Access Network Information 27  \n4.4.6.8 Temporary Network Failure handling 28  \n4.4.6.9 PLMN information change Notification 28  \n4.4.7 P-CSCF Restoration Enhancement Support 28  \n4.4.8 Priority Sharing Request 29  \n4.4.9 Support for media component versioning 29  \n4.4.10 Extended bandwidth support for EPC supporting Dual Connectivity\n(E-UTRAN and 5G NR) 30  \n4.4.11 MPS for DTS Control 30  \n4.4.12 Provisioning of MPS for DTS AF Signalling Flow Information 31  \n5 Rx protocol 32  \n5.1 Protocol support 32  \n5.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and\nsession 32  \n5.3 Rx specific AVPs 32  \n5.3.0 General 32  \n5.3.1 Abort-Cause AVP 35  \n5.3.2 Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP 36  \n5.3.3 Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP 36  \n5.3.4 Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP 36  \n5.3.5 AF-Application-Identifier AVP 36  \n5.3.6 AF-Charging-Identifier AVP 37  \n5.3.7 Codec-Data AVP 37  \n5.3.8 Flow-Description AVP 37  \n5.3.9 Flow-Number AVP 38  \n5.3.10 Flows AVP 38\n\nInformation 4:\n> configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources\n> (NRs).

Ignoring a further\ncorrection for lapse errors, the psychometric function for percentage of\ncorrect responses, with a high threshold assumption and correction for\nguesses can be written as \\[59\\]:  \n![](media/image108.png){width=\"1.90625in\"\nheight=\"0.19791666666666666in\"}  \nThe high threshold assumption is that the listener is in one of two\nstates: a detect state, with probability *p(x)*, and a non\u2011detected\nstate. If the stimulus is not detected, the listener guesses with a\nguess rate![](media/image109.png){width=\"0.125in\"\nheight=\"0.19791666666666666in\"} In forced choice tasks, the guess rate\nis dependent on the number of alternatives given, with:  \n![](media/image110.png){width=\"1.7291666666666667in\"\nheight=\"0.3020833333333333in\"}  \nFor a 2AFC experiment,![](media/image111.png){width=\"0.53125in\"\nheight=\"0.19791666666666666in\"}, resulting that\n![](media/image112.png){width=\"0.375in\"\nheight=\"0.19791666666666666in\"}=0.75 for a\n![](media/image113.png){width=\"0.3229166666666667in\"\nheight=\"0.19791666666666666in\"}=0.5. I.e. the listener correctly\ndetecting the presence of the impairment half of the time. In practice,\nthe actual threshold reported in experiments vary depending on the\nchoice of experiment chosen, since N-alternative adaptive forced choice\nexperiments converge at different levels \\[57\\].  \nIn addition, the level of latency that produces 75 % correct responses\nin 2AFC experiments is not necessarily the M2S level that should be\ntargeted for 3GPP immersive audio systems. A condition where the user is\nnoticing artifacts half of the time may not be the appropriate target\nfor 3GPP immersive audio services. For example, Lindau and Weinzierl\n\\[21\\] have assumed a![](media/image112.png){width=\"0.375in\"\nheight=\"0.19791666666666666in\"}=0,55 to be the detection level where\n\nInformation 2:\nwere asked to determine which of the presented samples had the added\nlatency.  \nFor each trial, participants were given feedback as to whether their\nresponses were correct or not. The starting latency for the test was set\nto a high level of 200ms. If the participant correctly determined the\nsample containing latency, the latency was reduced by one step.\nOtherwise, the latency was increased by three steps. The initial step\nsize was set to 200ms and was decreased by half after three reversals.\n4 step sizes were used. The three reversals for the last step size were\naveraged to determine a value close to the M2S latency detection\nthreshold. Due to the 3-down, 1-up nature of the adaptive procedure, the\nprocedure converges to a percentage of correct detections = 79,4 %.  \n#### 8.3.2.4 Participant\\'s motion instructions  \nParticipants were seated in a chair and were free to make the\nexploratory head movements that they felt was necessary to detect the\nM2S latency. Eventually, as trials progressed and feedback was being\ngiven, the participants adapted their head movements to the motion that\nbetter facilitated their discrimination. However, it is possible that a\nparticipant did not find the best motion strategy during the experiment.  \n#### 8.3.2.5 Stimuli  \nThe stimulus chosen was a continuous speech signal, taken from podcasts.\nWhile previous studies have chosen specific test signals for a high\nrepeatability of psychophysical stimulation, the idea in this\npreliminary experiment was to stimulate the participant with content\nthat is more approximate to the actual use case of interest and hence, a\nlong podcast was played throughout the experiment. For each trial, the\nactual stimulus presentation length was limited to 10s. This duration\nwas thought to be a good compromise between the time required to make\nexploratory head motions and the need to limit the duration of the\nexperiment.  \n#### 8.3.2.6 Test environment\n\nInformation 3:\n2022-08              SA5\\#145e   S5-225802    \\-   \\-    \\-    Use case on orchestrating AIML inference                                                      0.4.0\n2022-08              SA5\\#145e   S5-225043    \\-   \\-    \\-    Use case on improving AI/ML (re-)training efficiency                                          0.4.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226916    \\-   \\-    \\-    Addressing wording issues                                                                     0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226917    \\-   \\-    \\-    pCR 28.809 Clarifying simultaneous and separate execution of training and inference phases    0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226918    \\-   \\-    \\-    Corrections on terms and definitions                                                          0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226558    \\-   \\-    \\-    Corrections including editorials                                                              0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226924    \\-   \\-    \\-    Add use cases for AI/ML performance evaluation                                                0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226927    \\-   \\-    \\-    Add potential solutions for AI-ML performance evaluation                                      0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226919    \\-   \\-    \\-    Use case and potential solution on Abstraction of AIML performance                            0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226920    \\-   \\-    \\-    Selection of AIML performance indicators                                                      0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226921    \\-   \\-    \\-    Policy based selection of Performance Indicators                                              0.5.0\n2022-11              SA5\\#146    S5\u2011226928    \\-   \\-    \\-    Terminology on Trustworthy AI/ML                                                              0.5.0\n\nInformation 4:\nperformance in terms of time to iterate the synchronous federated\nlearning task to drop stragglers, but this will reduce the diversity of\nthe data set and introduce bias.  \nWhere group performance is defined by the weakest member (as in the\nslowest flying bird), we term this a \"flock.\" The 5GS normally considers\nperformance objectives and QoS for individual communicating terminals.\nHere, the 5GS QoS objective relates to the entire set of terminals\nmaking up the federation, the \"flock\" of UEs.\n\nInformation 5:\nmemory effects, each response should be independent of every other.  \nC.11.1 Example Instructions for Experiment 1\n--------------------------------------------  \nIn this test we are evaluating systems that might be used for a type of\ncommunications between separate places under a variety of conditions.\nYou are going to hear a number of samples of speech reproduced in the\nearpieces of the handset.

As\nsuch the accuracy that will be realistically achievable in an\noperational system will vary due to such factors as the dynamically\nvarying radio environments (considering signal attenuation and multipath\npropagation), network topography in terms of base station density and\ngeography, and positioning equipment available.  \nThe accuracy for location services can be expressed in terms of a range\nof values that reflect the general accuracy level needed for the\napplication. Different services require different levels of positioning\naccuracy. The range may vary from tens of meters (navigation services)\nto perhaps kilometers (fleet management).  \nThe majority of attractive value-added location services are enabled\nwhen location accuracies of between 25m and 200m can be provided.  \nBased on decreasing accuracy requirement some examples of location\nservices are provided in table 4.1.

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 5.1.2 Network energy saving  \nIt has been a global concern that the energy consumption of ICT\n(Information and Communication Technology) equipment is impacting the\nenvironment and contributing to the global warming. Energy efficiency\nfor mobile networks is very important, since 5G networks will consume\nmore energy due to the vast number of mmWave small cells. The network\nenergy saving use case in TR 37.817 \\[2\\] utilizes the AI/ML techniques\nwith model training residing in OAM and model inference residing in the\ngNB, where OAM will need to collect input data from RAN nodes to enable\nthe network energy saving model training, and then deploy the model to\nthe gNB to perform the inference function that will determine the energy\nsaving actions based on the input data received from the serving node.  \nTherefore, to support the model training residing in OAM, 3GPP\nmanagement service producer should be able to collect the following\ninput data (see clause 5.1.2.4 in TR 37.817 \\[2\\]):  \n\\- From serving node:  \n\\- UE mobility/trajectory prediction.  \n\\- Current/Predicted Energy efficiency.  \n\\- Current/Predicted resource status.  \n\\- From the UE:  \n\\- UE location information (e.g. coordinates, serving cell ID, moving\nvelocity) interpreted by gNB implementation when available.  \n\\- UE measurement report (e.g. UE RSRP, RSRQ, SINR measurement, etc.),\nincluding cell level and beam level UE measurements.  \n\\- From neighbouring NG-RAN nodes:  \n\\- Current/Predicted energy efficiency.  \n\\- Current/Predicted resource status.  \n\\- Current energy state (e.g. active, high, low, inactive).  \nTo optimize the performance of AI/ML-based network energy saving model,\nfollowing feedback can be considered to be collected from NG-RAN nodes:  \n\\- Resource status of neighbouring NG-RAN nodes.  \n\\- Energy efficiency.  \n\\- UE performance affected by the energy saving action (e.g. handed-over\nUEs), including bitrate, packet loss, latency.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 5.1.3 Load balancing  \nWith the rapid traffic growth, multiple frequency bands were utilized in\nthe commercial network. It is quite challenging to steer the traffic in\na balanced distribution so that the network performance could be\nassured. Load balancing had been proposed to address the issue. The\nobjective of load balancing is to distribute load evenly among cells and\namong areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic from congested\ncells or from congested areas of cells, or to offload users from one\ncell, cell area, carrier or RAT to improve network performance. This can\nbe done by means of optimization of handover parameters and handover\nactions. AI/ML capabilities, e.g. traffic load prediction, prediction of\nselected UE and/or target cell for handover, could be introduced to\nimprove the load balance performance, in terms of the quality user\nexperience and system capacity. It also enables the network automation\nwhich would help to reduce human intervention in the network management\nand optimization tasks. *To support the AI/ML based load balancing in\nRAN, the related AI/ML Model can be trained, validated and tested in OAM\nwhile AI/ML Model inference could be done in the gNB. In case of CU-DU\nsplit architecture,* AI/ML *Model* Training can be located in the OAM\nand AI/ML *Model* Inference can be located in the gNB-CU.  \nTo facilitate the AI/ML Model Training, validation and testing in OAM,\n3GPP management service producer should be able to collect the input\ndata, output data as well as the feedback of AI/ML based load balancing.\n(see clause 5.2.2. in TR 37.817 \\[2\\]). Note that the output data can be\nused as the label for the supervised learning. The feedback of AI/ML\nbased load balancing data could be used to re-tune the AI/ML model and\noptimize the AI/ML model for load balancing.  \nTo support the model training residing in OAM, 3GPP management service\nproducer should be able to collect the following input data:  \n\\- From serving node:\n\nInformation 3:\nsuccessful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover\nfailure occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to\nre-establish the radio link connection in the source cell.  \n\\- Intra-system Handover to Wrong Cell: An RLF occurs shortly after a\nsuccessful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover\nfailure occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to\nre-establish the radio link connection in a cell other than the source\ncell and the target cell.  \n\\- Successful Handover: During a successful handover, there is\nunderlying issue.  \nRAN Intelligence could observe multiple HO events with associated\nparameters, use this information to train its ML model and try to\nidentify sets of parameters that lead to successful Hos and sets of\nparameters that lead to unintended events.  \n**UE Location/Mobility/Performance Prediction**  \nPredicting UE's location is a key part for mobility optimisation, as\nmany RRM actions related to mobility (e.g., selecting handover target\ncells) can benefit from the predicted UE location/trajectory. UE\nmobility prediction is also one key factor in the optimization of early\ndata forwarding particularly for CHO. UE Performance prediction when the\nUE is served by certain cells is a key factor in determining which is\nthe best mobility target for maximisation of efficiency and performance.  \n**Traffic Steering**  \nEfficient resource handling can be achieved adjusting handover trigger\npoints and selecting optimal combination of Pcell/PSCell/Scells to serve\na user.  \nExisting traffic steering can also be improved by providing a RAN node\nwith information related to mobility or dual connectivity.  \nFor example, before initiating a handover, the source gNB could use\nfeedbacks on UE performance collected for successful handovers occurred\nin the past and received from neighbouring gNBs.  \nSimilarly, for the case of dual connectivity, before triggering the\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.1.1 Mobility optimization  \nMobility management is the scheme to guarantee the service-continuity\nduring the UE mobility by minimizing the call drops, RLFs, unnecessary\nhandovers, and ping-pong. The objective of mobility optimization is to\ndynamically improve the UE handover performance with aims to improve\nend-user experience and increase network capacity. The mobility\noptimization use case in TR 37.817 \\[2\\] utilizes the AI/ML techniques\nwith model training residing in OAM and model inference residing in the\ngNB to enhance the SON function in the following aspects:  \n\\- Reduction of the probability of unintended events.  \n\\- UE Location/Mobility/Performance prediction.  \n\\- Traffic Steering.  \nClause 5.3.2.2 in TR 37.817 \\[2\\] describes a solution of AI/ML Model\nTraining in OAM and AI/ML Model Inference in NG-RAN node, where OAM will\ncollect input data from the serving RAN node and neighbouring RAN nodes\nto train the mobility optimization model, and then deploy the model to\nthe serving RAN node to perform the inference function that will\nrecommend actions to enable gNB to perform the mobility optimization /\nhandover procedure to hand over UE(s) from serving NG-RAN node to the\ntarget NG-RAN node.  \nTherefore, to support the model training residing in OAM, 3GPP\nmanagement service producer should be able to collect the following\ninput data (see clause 5.3.2.4 in TR 37.817 \\[2\\]):  \n\\- From the UE:  \n\\- UE location information (e.g. coordinates, serving cell ID, moving\nvelocity) interpreted by gNB implementation when available.  \n\\- Radio measurements related to serving cell and neighbouring cells\nassociated with UE location information, e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, SINR.  \n\\- UE Mobility History Information.  \n\\- From the neighbouring RAN nodes:  \n\\- UE\\'s history information from neighbour.  \n\\- Position, QoS parameters and the performance information of\nhistorical HO-ed UE (e.g. loss rate, delay, etc.).  \n\\- Current/predicted resource status.\n\nInformation 5:\n|                      | traffic congestion,  |                      |\n|                      | the related          |                      |\n|                      | geographical         |                      |\n|                      | area/spot) so that a |                      |\n|                      | UE or learning agent |                      |\n|                      | can minimize the     |                      |\n|                      | impact of learning   |                      |\n|                      | data transfer        |                      |\n|                      | disturbance.         |                      |\n+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| \\[PR.7.3-004\\]       | 5G system shall be   | From this Use Case,  |\n|                      | able to support      | the relevant AI/ML   |\n| (see note 4)         | adaptive scheduling  | aspect is \"The       |\n|                      | (e.g., for network   | learning agent in    |\n| (see note 5)         | resource utilization | the cloud needs to   |\n|                      | for the              | be aware of data     |\n| \\[PR.7.3-004a\\]      | communication        | rate change (e.g.,   |\n|                      | between the 5G       | traffic demand       |\n|                      | system and AI/ML     | increase or          |\n|                      | application of a     | decrease) that has   |\n|                      | learning agent)      | been caused or will  |\n|                      | according to         | be caused by changes |\n|                      | increase or decrease | in workload sharing  |\n|                      | of AI/ML traffic     | such as start using  |\n|                      | demand due to        | or stop using task   |\n|                      | switching to a       | splitting, or        |\n|                      | different AI/ML      | changing task        |\n|                      | mode.                | splitting point that |\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of using a convolutional long short-term memory network (LSTM) in traffic prediction?\nOptions:\noption 1: To capture the spatial features of wireless traffic\noption 2: To model the dynamic temporal information of wireless traffic\noption 3: To optimize the caching decisions in wireless networks\noption 4: To estimate the wireless channel characteristics\noption 5: To predict the users' mobility patterns\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 2: To model the dynamic temporal information of wireless traffic\n"

In fact, this superior monitoring capability means that 5G can\nsubstantially improve the effectiveness of preventive care:  \n-   As 5G facilitates information collection, information transmission\n> and big data analytics, this is one of the essential ingredients\n> helping healthcare provision to change from a \\\"volume-based\\\"\n> model in which providers of health care are compensated for\n> quantity, not quality, to a \\\"value-based\\\" model in which\n> compensation is linked to the value delivered.  \n-   Additionally, improvements in well-being and quality of life, which\n> are not always captured in conventional economic measurements such\n> as the GDP, play a key role in work force productivity.  \nAlso, 5G enables shifting care location from hospitals to homes and\nothers lower cost facilities which mechanically translates into\nadditional savings. Additionally, another example showing that 5G can\nenable cost savings required by the medical industry can be found inside\nhospitals where wireless transmission of low latency data streams\nimproves operating room planning, enable streamlining equipment usage\n\nInformation 5:\nsystem capable of simultaneously supporting multiple combinations of\nreliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and availability. This\ntechnology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new\ntechnologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable\nassignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility\nand optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for\nlatency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio\ninterface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the\ncore network, such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting\nservices closer to the end points.  \nA 5G system also supports new business models such as those for IoT and\nenterprise managed networks. Drivers for the 5G KPIs include services\nsuch as Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control, Augmented Reality (AR),\nand factory automation. Network flexibility enhancements support\nself-contained enterprise networks, installed and maintained by network\noperators while being managed by the enterprise. Enhanced connection\nmodes and evolved security facilitate support of massive IoT, expected\nto include tens of millions of UEs sending and receiving data over the\n5G network.  \nFlexible network operations are the mainstay of the 5G system. The\ncapabilities to provide this flexibility include network slicing,\nnetwork capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility. Other\nnetwork operations requirements address the necessary control and data\nplane resource efficiencies, as well as network configurations that\noptimize service delivery by minimizing routing between end users and\napplication servers. Enhanced charging and security mechanisms handle\nnew types of UEs connecting to the network in different ways.  \nMobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs.\nThese pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility,\nhighly variable data rates, deployment, and coverage.

This may not be a scalable solution where tens of UEs may\ntry to access the controllee UE. In order to solve this problem, the\nPN-user may configure a controller UE, after processing of this decision\nnormal session initiation procedures may be continued. Once the\ncontroller UE has been chosen, to handle all session initiation requests\nfrom UEs whose identities are not configured in the access control list,\na query can be directed to the particular controller UE.  \nThe controller UE in turn is capable of checking the access control\ninformation of this query. Options may be given to the PN-user to either\naccept the call himself, or answer the query by allowing the call to go\nthrough to the intended destination (controllee UE) or deny the call. In\naddition the user may be given an option of saving this policy for\nfuture call requests by the same source. Once the user makes the\ndecision, a response message carrying this information may be sent\ndirecting the session back to the original destination.  \nThe PNM AS receives the response message from the S-CSCF. If the\ndecision of the PN-user was to allow the call, it sends the original\ninitial request message. If required to save (based on user response) it\nsaves the settings for the originating UE in the access control list\n\nQuestion: What are the two strategies used in handling control information exchanges in the contention-based access?\nOptions:\noption 1: (a) Multi-step grant-based procedure and (b) Two-step grant-free procedure\noption 2: (a) Single-step grant-based procedure and (b) Three-step grant-free procedure\noption 3: (a) Two-step grant-based procedure and (b) Multi-step grant-free procedure\noption 4: (a) Three-step grant-based procedure and (b) Single-step grant-free procedure\noption 5: (a) Randomized step procedure and (b) Deterministic step procedure\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 1: (a) Multi-step grant-based procedure and (b) Two-step grant-free procedure\n"

Command and\ncontrol (C2) communications refers to the two-way communication, which\nmay include video, required to control the operation of the UAV itself.\nC2 messages may be communicated with the UAV controller, the UTM or both\nand may or may not be periodic.

However, when comparing 8-PSK and\n16-QAM with equal payload sizes, the lower operating point of 16-QAM\neffectively compensates the sensitivity loss due to tighter\nconstellation.

For peak\nrate impacts from other combinations of UE complexity reduction\ntechniques, see clause 7.8.3.  \n**Latency and reliability:**  \nHD-FDD introduces longer latency than FD-HDD, especially in case of\nsimultaneous downlink and uplink traffic, but the latency and\nreliability requirements of RedCap use cases can still be fulfilled at\nleast for one direction (downlink or uplink).  \n**Power consumption:**  \nThe lower insertion loss of an HD-FDD UE may enable a higher power\nefficiency in the transmit chain and reduce power consumption.\nFurthermore, compared to the reference NR modem, half-duplex operation\nmeans some components can work in a reduced power state until required.\nHowever, on the other hand, HD-FDD may have a negative impact on UE\naverage power consumption because the UE will be active for a longer\ntime before being able to return to a lower power light sleep or deep\nsleep state. The impact on power consumption of HD-FDD depends on\nimplementation and traffic characteristics.  \n**PDCCH blocking rate:**  \nHD-FDD operation may potentially reduce the available PDCCH monitoring\noccasions when the UE is transmitting rather than receiving.\n\nQuestion: What is the advantage of using direct-sequence modulation over frequency-hopping modulation in terms of interference response?

The lowest level of services is paging\nservice, where a hybrid cell allows a non-member UE to access the cell\nto receive pages. A paging only hybrid cell is an interesting\nalternative to pure CSG cells.

The difference is that the\nhybrid cell has more information about the victim UE than a CSG cell.\nWhen the hybrid cell decides to handover (HO) the UE to a macro cell,\ninterference coordination could be negotiated with the macro as part of\nthe HO procedure. Some examples, are:  \n1\\. DL interference: The hybrid cell could reduce transmit power such\nthat the UE handed over to the target cell has sufficient DL C/I to\nreceive DL control channels from the target cell. The hybrid cell could\nalso engage in fractional frequency reuse (FFR) with the target cell to\nenhance DL data rate of the victim UE.  \n2\\. UL interference: A hybrid cell and HO target cell could choose the\npower setting of this UE such that UL interference could be coordinated.\nUL control channels of the HO sUE could also be orthogonalized with the\nPUCCH of the source hybrid cell. UL data channel coordination through UL\nFFR could be configured on a semi-static basis.  \nNote that hybrid cells also have additional information on the channel\nquality of active UEs.

The lowest level of services is paging\nservice, where a hybrid cell allows a non-member UE to access the cell\nto receive pages. A paging only hybrid cell is an interesting\nalternative to pure CSG cells. Since CSG cells have separate PCID space,\nswitching between CSG and hybrid mode would have impact on both idle\nstate and connected state home UEs. On the contrary, a hybrid cell could\nwith paging-only service provides similar functionality as a CSG cell\nwithout incurring CSG-hybrid switching penalty.  \nIf a hybrid cell only provides paging services to non-member UEs, data\nchannel interference is similar to CSG HeNBs. The difference is that the\nhybrid cell has more information about the victim UE than a CSG cell.\nWhen the hybrid cell decides to handover (HO) the UE to a macro cell,\ninterference coordination could be negotiated with the macro as part of\nthe HO procedure. Some examples, are:  \n1\\. DL interference: The hybrid cell could reduce transmit power such\nthat the UE handed over to the target cell has sufficient DL C/I to\nreceive DL control channels from the target cell. The hybrid cell could\nalso engage in fractional frequency reuse (FFR) with the target cell to\nenhance DL data rate of the victim UE.  \n2\\. UL interference: A hybrid cell and HO target cell could choose the\npower setting of this UE such that UL interference could be coordinated.\nUL control channels of the HO sUE could also be orthogonalized with the\nPUCCH of the source hybrid cell. UL data channel coordination through UL\nFFR could be configured on a semi-static basis.  \nNote that hybrid cells also have additional information on the channel\nquality of active UEs. Hence the adjustment made at the hybrid cell\ncould fully take into account on the impact to ongoing traffic.

In \\[5\\], extensive deployment\nscenarios of hybrid cells have been discussed. The interference\nscenarios apply to most of the deployments listed in \\[5\\].  \nFor the scenario where HeNBs are on a shared carrier with eNBs, the\ninterference management considerations are different between closed and\nhybrid access modes. For the closed access mode the used HeNB resources\n(e.g. power, RBs) are selected as a trade-off between performance at the\nHeNB/HUEs and interference caused to the macro eNB/MUEs. For the hybrid\naccess mode the trade-off is between overall system performance\n(including both macro eNB and HeNB layers), and resources consumed at\nthe HeNB by \\\"visiting\\\" (i.e. non-CSG member) UEs. These aspects are\nconsidered in more detail in the following sub-sections.\n\nInformation 5:\nextreme scenarios, hybrid cell could handover both the member UEs and\nnon-member UEs to the macro cell.  \nIf a hybrid cell provides data services to non-member UEs, the hybrid\nHeNB is similar to a pico cell with lower Tx power and different service\nlevel for members and non-members. In addition, a hybrid HeNB is\ndifferent from a operator deployed pico cell in the following areas  \n1\\. A release 9 hybrid HeNB does not support X2 interface.  \n2\\. A hybrid HeNB could be customer deployed without proper RF planning  \n3\\. The density of hybrid HeNB could have much high density than\noperator deployed pico cells.  \nGiven the challenges mentioned above, non-Rel-8 interference\ncoordination schemes should be investigated for hybrid cells.\n\nQuestion: What is a Hybrid CPE?\nOptions:\noption 1: A CPE that is attached to both an xDSL and a 4G network.\noption 2: A CPE that is attached to both an xDSL and an Ethernet network.\noption 3: A CPE that supports both xDSL and LTE technologies.\noption 4: A CPE that supports both Ethernet and LTE technologies.\noption 5: A CPE that supports both Ethernet and Wi-Fi technologies.\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer option 1: A CPE that is attached to both an xDSL and a 4G network.\n"

It also supports\nmulti-cluster assignment of DFTS-OFDM.  \nFigure 5.2.1-1: Transmitter scheme of SC-FDMA  \nThe uplink sub-carrier spacing *\u2206f* = 15 kHz. The sub-carriers are\ngrouped into sets of 12 consecutive sub-carriers, corresponding to the\nuplink resource blocks. 12 consecutive sub-carriers during one slot\ncorrespond to one uplink *resource block*. In the frequency domain, the\nnumber of resource blocks, N~RB~, can range from N~RB-min~ = 6 to\nN~RB-max~ = 110 per carrier or per CC in case of CA or DC.  \nThere are two cyclic-prefix lengths defined: Normal cyclic prefix and\nextended cyclic prefix corresponding to seven and six SC-FDMA symbol per\nslot respectively.  \n\\- Normal cyclic prefix: T~CP~ = 160\u00d7Ts (SC-FDMA symbol \\#0), T~CP~ =\n144\u00d7Ts (SC-FDMA symbol \\#1 to \\#6)  \n\\- Extended cyclic prefix: T~CP-e~ = 512\u00d7Ts (SC-FDMA symbol \\#0 to\nSC-FDMA symbol \\#5)\n\nInformation 4:\nIndication field (TFRI) on an associated shared control channel.  \nIn case of FDD E-DCH the identification of the transport format is\nrealised with the E-DCH Transport Format Combination Indication field\n(E-TFCI) on a associated dedicated control channel.  \nIn the case of TDD E-DCH the identification of the transport format is\nrealised with the E-DCH Transport Format Combination Indication field\n(E-TFCI) multiplexed onto E-PUCH.  \n5.2 Overview of L1 functions\n----------------------------  \nThe physical layer performs the following main functions:  \n\\- FEC encoding/decoding of transport channels;  \n\\- measurements and indication to higher layers (e.g. FER, SIR,\ninterference power, transmission power, etc...);  \n\\- macrodiversity distribution/combining and soft handover execution;  \n\\- error detection on transport channels;  \n\\- multiplexing of transport channels and demultiplexing of coded\ncomposite transport channels;  \n\\- rate matching;  \n\\- mapping of coded composite transport channels on physical channels;  \n\\- modulation and spreading/demodulation and despreading of physical\nchannels;  \n\\- frequency and time (chip, bit, slot, frame) synchronisation;  \n\\- closed-loop power control;  \n\\- power weighting and combining of physical channels;  \n\\- RF processing;  \n\\- support of Uplink Synchronisation as defined in \\[5\\] (TDD only);  \n\\- timing advance on uplink channels (TDD only).  \n5.3 L1 interactions with L2 retransmission functionality\n--------------------------------------------------------  \nProvided that the RLC PDUs are mapped one-to-one onto the Transport\nBlocks, Error indication may be provided by L1 to L2. For that purpose,\nthe L1 CRC can be used for individual error indication of each RLC PDU.  \nThe L1 CRC may serve multiple purposes:  \n\\- error indication for uplink macro diversity selection combining (L1);  \n\\- error indication for each erroneous Transport Block in transparent\nand unacknowledged mode RLC;  \n\\- quality indication;\n\nInformation 5:\n|             |             |             |             |             |\n| (if it is   |             |             |             |             |\n| used        |             |             |             |             |\n| together    |             |             |             |             |\n| with CPP)   |             |             |             |             |\n+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\n| Carrier     | time-domain | time-domain | time-domain | time-domain |\n| phase       |             |             |             |             |\n| estimation  |             |             |             |             |\n| techniques  |             |             |             |             |\n|             |             |             |             |             |\n| (t          |             |             |             |             |\n| ime-domain, |             |             |             |             |\n| f           |             |             |             |             |\n| req-domain, |             |             |             |             |\n| references) |             |             |             |             |\n+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\n| D           | None        | None        | None        | None        |\n| ifferential |             |             |             |             |\n| positioning |             |             |             |             |\n| techniques  |             |             |             |             |\n| if used     |             |             |             |             |\n|             |             |             |             |             |\n| (e.g.,      |             |             |             |             |\n| single      |             |             |             |             |\n| di          |             |             |             |             |\n| fferential, |             |             |             |             |\n\nQuestion: The information carrier in FDM is localized in which domain?\nOptions:\noption 1: Time domain\noption 2: Frequency domain\noption 3: DD domain\noption 4: None of the above\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 2: Frequency domain\n"

A CNN is composed of\nmultiple convolutional layers, as shown in figure A.4-2. Applying\nvarious convolutional filters, CNN models can capture the high-level\nrepresentation of the input data, making it popular for image\nclassification \\[7\\] and speech recognition \\[42\\] tasks. In recent\nyears, the modern CNN models have dramatically improved the performance\nof image classification tasks (e.g., AlexNet \\[7\\], VGG network \\[8\\],\nGoogleNet \\[9\\], ResNet \\[18\\], MobileNet \\[19\\]), as shown in figure\nA.4-3 \\[25\\].  \n![](media/image36.jpeg){width=\"3.8715277777777777in\"\nheight=\"1.6888888888888889in\"}  \nFigure A.4-2.

The input of RNN consists of the\ncurrent input and the previous samples. Each neuron in an RNN owns an\ninternal memory that keeps the information of the computation from the\nprevious samples. As shown in figure A.4-4, the basic unit of RNN is\ncalled cell, and further, each cell consists of layers and a series of\ncells enables the sequential processing of RNN models. RNN models have\nbeen widely used in the natural language processing task on mobile\ndevices, e.g., language modelling, machine translation, question\nanswering, word embedding, and document classification.  \n![](media/image38.jpeg){width=\"3.4715277777777778in\"\nheight=\"1.8472222222222223in\"}  \nFigure A.4-4.

As illustrated in\nfigure A.4-5, the goal of DRL is to create an intelligent agent that can\nperform efficient policies to maximize the rewards of long-term tasks\n\nInformation 2:\ncomputational neural network. The neurons in the input layer receive\nsome values and propagate them to the neurons in the middle layer of the\nnetwork, which is also called a \"hidden layer\". The weighted sums from\none or more hidden layers are ultimately propagated to the output layer,\nwhich presents the final outputs of the network \\[25\\].  \n![](media/image32.jpeg){width=\"2.220138888888889in\" height=\"1.3125in\"}\n![](media/image33.jpeg){width=\"2.1381944444444443in\"\nheight=\"1.9673611111111111in\"}  \n(a) \\(b\\)  \nFigure A.2-1. Architecture of neuron and neural network  \nNeural networks having more than three layers, i.e., more than one\nhidden layer are called ***deep neural networks (DNN)***. In contrast to\nthe conventional shallow-structured NN architectures, DNNs, also\nreferred to as deep learning, made amazing breakthroughs since 2010s in\nmany essential application areas because they can achieve human-level\naccuracy or even exceed human accuracy. Deep learning techniques use\nsupervised and/or unsupervised strategies to automatically learn\nhierarchical representations in deep architectures for classification\n\\[26\\]. With a large number of hidden layers, the superior performance\nof DNNs comes from its ability to extract high-level features from raw\nsensory data after using statistical learning over a large amount of\ndata to obtain an effective representation of an input space \\[25\\]. In\nrecent years, thanks to the big data obtained from the real world, the\nrapidly increased computation capacity and continuously-evolved\nalgorithms, DNNs have become the most popular ML models for many AI\napplications.  \nA.3 Training and inference\n--------------------------  \n***Training*** is a process in which a AI/ML model learns to perform its\ngiven tasks, more specifically, by optimizing the value of the weights\nin the DNN. A DNN is trained by inputting a training set, which are\noften correctly-labelled training samples.

Example of AI/ML inference  \nThe performance of DNNs is gained at the cost of high computational\ncomplexity. Hence more efficient compute engines are often used, e.g.\ngraphics processing units (GPU) and network processing units (NPU).\nCompared to the inference which only involves the feedforward process,\nthe training often requires more computation and storage resources\nbecause it involves also the backpropagation process \\[10\\].  \nA.4 Widely-used DNN models and algorithms\n-----------------------------------------  \nMany DNN models have been developed over the past two decades. Each of\nthese models has a different \"network architecture\" in terms of number\nof layers, layer types, layer shapes (i.e., filter size, number of\nchannels and filters), and connections between layers \\[25\\]. Figure\nA.4-1 presents three popular structures of DNNs: multilayer perceptrons\n(MLPs), convolution neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs). ***Multilayer perceptrons (MLP)*** model is the most\nbasic DNN, which is composed of a series of fully connected layers\n\\[41\\]. In a fully connected layer, all outputs are connected to all\ninputs, as shown in Figure A.4-1.

AI/ML capabilities are being increasingly adopted in mobile\nnetworks as a key enabler for wide range of features and functionalities\nthat maximise efficiency and bring intelligence and automation in\nvarious domains of the 5GS. For example, these include the Management\nData Analytics (MDA) in the management and orchestration \\[1\\], the\nNetwork Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in the 5G core network domain\n\\[3\\], and NG-RAN (e.g. RAN intelligence) defined in 3GPP TS 38.300\n\\[16\\] and 3GPP TS 38.401 \\[19\\].  \nThe AI/ML inference functions in the 5GS use the ML model for inference\nand in order to enable and facilitate the AI/ML adoption, the ML model\nneeds to be created, trained and then managed during its entire\nlifecycle.  \nTo enable, facilitate and support AI/ML-capabilities in the 5GS, the\nfollowing management capabilities are studied in the present document:  \n\\- Validation of ML model or entity.  \n\\- Testing of ML model or entity (before deployment).  \n\\- Deployment of ML model or entity (new or updated model/entity).  \n\\- Configuration of ML training and AI/ML inference.  \n\\- Performance evaluation of ML training and AI/ML inference.  \nNOTE: The ML model training capability is specified in 3GPP TS 28.105\n\\[4\\].  \n4.3 AI/ML workflow for 5GS\n--------------------------\n\nInformation 4:\nML Machine Learning  \n4 Concepts and overview\n=======================  \n4.1 Overview\n------------  \nManagement Data Analytics (MDA), as a key enabler of automation and\nintelligence, is considered a foundational capability for mobile\nnetworks and services management and orchestration.  \nThe MDA provides a capability of processing and analysing data related\nto network and service events and status including e.g. performance\nmeasurements, KPIs, Trace/MDT/RLF/RCEF reports, QoE reports, alarms,\nconfiguration data, network analytics data, and service experience data\nfrom AFs, etc. to provide analytics output, i.e. statistics or\npredictions,, root cause analysis issues, and may also include\nrecommendations to enable necessary actions for network and service\noperations.

It is possible to limit the searching\nrange in case *\u011d~p~* is mandated to lie below certain threshold. To\nallow reducing the search range, the codebook entries are sorted in\nascending order according to the value of *\u011d~p~*.  \nThe gain quantization is performed by calculating the following MMSE\ncriterion for each codebook entry  \n$E = c_{0}{\\hat{g}}_{p}^{2} + c_{1}{\\hat{g}}_{p} + c_{2}\\lbrack\\hat{\\gamma}g_{c0}\\rbrack^{2} + c_{3}\\hat{\\gamma}g_{c0} + c_{4}{\\hat{g}}_{p}\\hat{\\gamma}g_{c0} + c_{5}$\n(571)  \nwhere the constants *c*~0~, *c*~1~, *c*~2,~ *c*~3,~ *c*~4~ and *c*~5~\nare calculated as  \n$c_{0} = y^{T}y,\\ c_{1} = x^{T}y,\\ c_{2} = z^{T}z,\\ c_{3} = x^{T}z,\\ c_{4} = y^{T}z,\\ c_{5} = x^{T}x$\n(572)  \nin which *x*(*i*) is the target signal, *y*(*i*) is the filtered\nadaptive excitation signal and *z*(*i*) is the filtered algebraic\nexcitation signal. The codevector leading to the lowest energy is chosen\nas the winning codevector and its entries correspond to the quantized\nvalues of *g~p~* and **.  \nBefore the gain quantization process it is assumed that both the\nfiltered adaptive and innovation codewords are already known. The gain\nquantization at the encoder is performed by searching the designed gain\ncodebook in the MMSE sense. Each entry in the gain codebook consists of\ntwo values: the quantized gain of the adaptive part and the correction\nfactor $\\gamma$ for the algebraic part of the excitation. The estimation\nof the algebraic gain excitation is done beforehand and the resulting\n*g~c~*~0~ is used to multiply the correction factor selected from the\ncodebook.

The AMF provides the information to LMF when it\ndetermines that the UE connects to MBSR based on the additional\ninformation from NG-RAN as described in solution\\#7, \\#8, \\#14, \\#15 and\n\\#18. However, it is not described in solution\\#15 that how the AMF\nmakes the decision. Furthermore, solution\\#15 also includes another way\nfor LMF to make the decision, i.e. based on UE positioning capability\nwhich is enhanced to include MBSR access provided by UE via LPP. But it\nis also not described that how the UE determines that it connects to\nMBSR.  \nAll solutions believe that the Target UE shall behave as a legacy UE and\nno new UE features are needed to support LCS for UEs accessing the\nnetwork via a MBSR, e.g. the Target UE reports the cell-ID in the DL\npositioning report to the LMF.  \nIn most of the solutions, it is assumed that for the positioning\nprocedure that involves MBSR measurements, the LMF obtains the MBSR\nlocation to calculate target UE location. How the LMF derives the\nlocation of the MBSR differs between the solutions. The LMF triggers the\nAMF that serves the MBSR directly (solution \\#7 with one alternative\nusing UDM, \\#14 and \\#18), or the LMF request the GMLC to derive the\nlocation (Solution \\#8). The GMLC will trigger the serving AMF in the\nnext step. In both approaches the LMF needs to obtain the UE-ID of the\nMBSR. The third approach (in Solution \\#7 with another alternative,\nSolution\\#8 with UL positioning alternative and Solution \\#15) is that\nthe LMF requests the location and velocity of the MBSR by using modified\nNRPPa procedure.  \nFor Solution\\#15 and solution 7 with one alternative, the MBSR location\nis obtained by the UE\\'s LMF using NRPPa query for TRP location, and no\nUE ID for MBSR is needed.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 2.22.7 MME F-TEID for Sm (Control Plane)  \nThe MME F-TEID for Sm (Control Plane) is defined in\n3GPPTS29.274\\[75\\]. This is temporary data conditionally stored in\nMBMS GW and MME.\n\nInformation 4:\nmeasurements shall be done at the same time T. During the positioning\nprocedure, this solution does not require any additional interaction\nbetween LMF and the RAN.  \n\\- Solution\\#15 proposed that the AMF serving the UE indicates to the\nLMF the existence of the MBSR. The LMF either obtains the MBSR position\ninformation when receiving the measurement reports from MBSR or by\nquerying the MBSR with a specific time information. The interaction\nbetween LMF and RAN via NRPPa message to obtain MBSR location introduces\nadditional latency. The MBSR velocity information is taken into\nconsideration to determine the MBSR location at the requested time. The\nLMF requests the MBSR positioning information via NRPPa procedure\nsimilar to obtaining location information of a TRP. It\\'s not clear how\nMBSR/TRP retrieves the location information.  \n\\- Solution \\#18 proposed that the NG-RAN keeps the 5G-GUTI of the MBSR,\nand provides that to the UE-AMF in the Initial UE message. All the\ninformation needed for UE positioning can be determined by UE-AMF before\nLMF initiating a position procedure for a target UE as this is MBSR\nspecific. When location request is sent to the LMF, UE-AMF provides also\nthe 5G-GUTI of MBSR, so that additional location procedure for MBSR can\nbe triggered by the LMF. During the positioning procedure, this solution\ndoes not require any additional interaction between LMF and the RAN.  \n\\- Solution \\#19 proposed to several options to avoid sending privacy\ncheck signalling toward MBSR nodes, in order to optimize the network\noperations.  \nIt is clear from the above that all solutions assume that the AMF\nserving the UE would need to be informed of the existence of the MBSR.\nThis can be achieved via either an explicit indication from NG-RAN, or\nthe additional ULI information. Solutions 7 and 8 however can derive\nwhich TRP in a positioning estimation is mobile and the MBSR UE ID from\nother means (i.e. NRPPa).\n\nInformation 5:\n### 2.10.6 MME Number for MT SMS  \nMME number for MT SMS is the E.164 address for the MME that supports SMS\nin MME. It is defined in 3GPPTS23.003\\[5\\].

The spatial division multiplexing of the\nmodulation symbol streams for different UEs using the same\ntime-frequency resource is denoted as spatial division multiple access\n(SDMA) or multi-user (MU)-MIMO.  \nModes of operation of multiple transmit antennas at the cell site\n(denoted as MIMO mode) are spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and\nsingle-stream transmit diversity mode(s). The MIMO mode is restricted by\nthe UE capability, e.g. number of receive antennas, and is determined\ntaking into account the slow channel variation. The MIMO mode is adapted\nslowly (e.g. only at the beginning of communication or every several 100\nmsec), in order to reduce the required control signalling (including\n\nInformation 3:\n|                  |                                                  |\n|                  | -- spatial multiplexing techniques,              |\n|                  |                                                  |\n|                  | -- spatial transmit diversity techniques,        |\n|                  |                                                  |\n|                  | -- beam-forming techniques (e.g., analog,        |\n|                  | digital, hybrid).                                |\n|                  |                                                  |\n|                  | ***[For NR component RIT:]{.underline}***        |\n|                  |                                                  |\n|                  | *The multi-antenna systems in NR supports the    |\n|                  | following MIMO transmission schemes at both the  |\n|                  | UE and the base station:*                        |\n|                  |                                                  |\n|                  | -   *Spatial multiplexing with DM-RS based       |\n|                  |     closed loop and semi-open loop transmission  |\n|                  |     schemes are supported.

The impacts of the key pair storage are studied in the\nfollowing clauseA.4.  \nA.4 Security risk analysis related to key pair storage\n======================================================  \nThere are many different subscriber use-cases describing the range of\napplications or services utilizing subscriber certificates. But, the\nlevel of trust associated to the proposed services depends on the key\npair storage. This will be presented in the following security risk\nanalysis.  \nA.4.1 Subscriber certificate use-cases\n--------------------------------------  \nThe use-cases for subscriber certificates can be divided into 2 main\ncategories:\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.1.2 Threats  \nWithout confidentiality, integrity and replay protection, an attacker\nmay eavesdrop or manipulate or replay the communication or initiate the\nMitM attacks on the interface.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.16.1 Key issue detail  \nAs an extension to key issue \\#7 \\'Memory Introspection\\' and key issue\n\\#19 \\'Time Manipulation\\', in a virtualised environment it is necessary\nto explicitly consider the risk to cryptographic processing of data\nwithin a VNF where a fully hardened HSM or HMEE is not used to perform\nthe cryptographic function.  \nMost software manipulating data with cryptographic operations will\nperform modification actions on encrypted data by first unencrypting the\ndata either in general memory (less than ideal) or CPU cache (better but\nvulnerabilities still exist). Following the necessary processing, the\ndata will be encrypted again.  \nWithin existing SA3 specifications, while some specialist operations are\nperformed in tamper resistant hardware (e.g.UICC), the bulk of\ncryptographic processing (e.g. user plane protection) will be performed\nusing general X86 (or similar) servers within the core network.  \nIn a virtualised environment there are various ways in which unencrypted\ndata can be captured; through the hypervisor; server management\nhardware; modification of VNF images; instantiating a parallel VM on the\nsame physical CPU; or any number of other options. The risks of being\nable to capture encrypted data in an unencrypted form due to processing\nof that data, increases significantly. If that processing is highly\nsensitive (e.g. AUC or LI functions) then the risk may not be\nacceptable. Placing entire VMs in fully hardened HMEEs may reduce the\nrisk in the longer term, but not all cryptographic functions can be\nplaced in a HMEE (this will not scale) and currently no suitable X86 (or\nsimilar architecture) HMEEs exist in commercial data centre servers\ncapable of the scale required to support 5G deployments.\n\nInformation 5:\nData Integrity: maintenance of the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its entire life cycle                                                                                                                                                       X             X\nIntegrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services against accidental loss, destruction or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data   X             X            For telcos, this requirement leads to the need of having self-assessment of systems related to their ability to process the data according to regulatory rules\nExistence of a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing                                                                              X             X            For telcos this means the ability to monitor and assess security policies and their efficiency\nTraceability: care providers to determine the initial source of the data, and what happened to it through its various locations and transformations.

Over recent years, the emphasis in intelligent vehicle\nresearch has turned to co-operative systems, in which the traffic\nparticipants (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.) communicate with\neach other and/or with the infrastructure.  \nCooperative ITS is the term used to describe technology that allows\nvehicles to become connected to each other, and to the infrastructure\nand other parts of the transport network. In addition to what drivers\ncan immediately see around them, and what vehicle sensors can detect,\nall parts of the transport system will increasingly be able to share\ninformation to improve decision making. Thus, this technology can\nimprove road safety through avoiding collisions, but also assist in\nreducing congestion and improving traffic flows, and reduce\nenvironmental impacts. Once the basic technology is in place as a\nplatform, an array of applications can be developed.  \nCooperative ITS can greatly increase the quality and reliability of\ninformation available about vehicles, their location and the road\nenvironment. In the future, cars will know the location of road works\nand the switching phases of traffic lights ahead, and they will be able\nto react accordingly. This will make for safer and more convenient\ntravel and faster arrival at the destination. On-board driver\nassistance, coupled with two-way communication between vehicles and\nbetween vehicles and road infrastructure, can help drivers to better\ncontrol their vehicle and hence have positive effects in terms of safety\nand traffic efficiency. An important role in this plays the so-called\nroad side units (RSUs). Vehicles can also function as sensors reporting\n\nInformation 2:\n### 9.2.1 ETSI-ITS  \nDue to the high data rate and transmission frequency requirements of\nsending raw sensor data, ETSI-ITS has been working on object-based\nsolutions. It has developed a Common Data Dictionary (CDD) in TS 102 894\n\\[23\\] and a specification TS 103 324 \\[24\\] \"Collective Perception (CP)\nService\" which specifies how an ITS station can inform other ITS\nstations about the position, dynamics and attributes of detected\nneighbouring road users and other objects. The CP service shares\ninformation with other ITS stations through the transmission of\nCollective Perception Messages (CPMs) and Environmental Perception\nMessages (EPMs) as illustrated in figure 9.1-1.  \n![](media/image13.png){width=\"6.295138888888889in\"\nheight=\"2.9652777777777777in\"}  \nFigure 9.1-1: Collective perception  \nETSI-ITS also developed a list of recommended requirements for the\nCollective Perception Service in TR 103 562 \\[25\\]. This identifies\nrelevant issues for object-based sensor sharing such as:  \n\\- Conditions that generate CPMs with object information  \n\\- The frequency at which CPMs should be sent  \n\\- CPM object quality assessment  \n\\- CP message formats and data elements\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.4.1 Description  \nToday, most automated driving vehicles rely on a single controller,\nwhich is the vehicle itself: sensing and controlling features of its own\n\\[3\\]. Since 3GPP Rel-14, LTE-based support for V2V features have been\ndeveloped and tested through collaborative participation from automotive\nand communication industry. However, it is still challenging to use\nautomated driving functionalities in general unstructured settings, if\nthe controlling features are based on a single controller, having no\nidea on how neighbouring vehicles will behave.  \nThis consequently requires that the automated driving system should\nallocate an extra safety margin into the planned trajectory which in\nturn causes traffic flow to be reduced and causes inefficiency to happen\nin a large scale network of vehicle networks where non-V2X vehicles and\nV2X-enabled vehicles possibly coexist. This is not even a problem for\nsuch an automated driving of road vehicles -- the same applies to the\noperations of \"automated manoeuvring robots\" in unstructured settings.\nWithout cooperation, the field of perception of a vehicle/robots is\nlimited to the local coverage of the onboard sensors -- not only for the\nrelative distance, relative angle.  \nAs a technology enabler solution against such problems of guaranteeing\nsafety and traffic efficiency, it is being studied to share the sensor\ninformation \\[9\\] and manoeuver sharing \\[8\\] in SAE. Tactile Internet\nfor V2N (potentially with assistance from edge cloud instead of general\ncloud servers) or V2V can enable an ultra-fast and reliable exchange of\nhighly detailed sensor data sets between nearby vehicles, along with\nhaptic information on trajectory \\[3\\]. Also, it would be one of the key\nfactors for so-called \"cooperative perception and manoeuvring\"\nfunctionalities \\[10\\]: planning cooperative manoeuvers among multiple\nautomated driving vehicle (or robots), such as plan creation, target\n\nInformation 4:\n| ronment |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Per     |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| ception |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+  \nNOTE 1: 15 Mbps assumes video compression.  \nNOTE 2: Video delay caused by latency must be within the tolerance of\nthe human driver. For example, a vehicle at 90 km/h moves 1.25 m within\n50 ms.  \nNOTE 3: It is still to be determined whether the four cameras are\nproducing a 360 video with same quality in all four directions, using\ntwo cameras facing front (e.g., with FoW of 120\u00b0 and 40\u00b0, and same or\ndifferent quality).

        "question": "Which wireless resource management class of problems involves allocation of orthogonal, licensed channels to unlicensed users?",

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nstreaming video clients. The scheduling priorities to users are\ncontinuously adjusted based not only on the absolute values of client\nmedia buffer levels but also on the rate of change of these buffer\nlevels. Also since the optimization objective is not changed, this\napproach allows for flexibility in choosing custom optimization\ncriterion including that of proportional fair and those based on\nvideo-quality metrics. Thus this approach is also friendly to non-video\nusers that are served by the same base station.  \nIn most cellular wireless networks, the UEs send to the BS periodic\nfeedback regarding the quality of wireless link that they are\nexperiencing in the form of Channel Quality Information (CQI). The CQI\nsent by the UEs is discretized, thus making the overall channel state\n\\\"m\\\" discrete. The eNodeB translates the CQI information into a peak\nrate vector, with representing the peak achievable rate by user j in\nchannel state m. For every scheduling resource, the eNodeB has to make a\ndecision as to which user to schedule in that resource. Scheduling the\nbest user always would result in maximum cell throughput but may result\nin poor fairness. Scheduling resources in a round robin fashion might\nresult in inability to take advantage of the wireless link quality\ninformation that is available. So, typical resource allocation\nalgorithms in wireless networks seeks to optimize the average service\nrates **R** = (R~1~, R~2~, R~3~,...R~J~) to users such that a concave\nutility function H(**R**) is maximized subject to the capacity\n(resource) limits in the wireless scenario under consideration i.e.,  \nwhere **V** represents the capacity region of the system. Utility\nfunctions of the sum form have attracted the most interest:  \nwhere each H~j~(R~j~) is a strictly concave continuously differentiable\nfunction defined for R~j~ \\> 0.

Also, for purposes of illustration, we have\nassumed that only slots 0 to 5 are available for allocation (so we\nassume that slots 6 and 7 are being used for other mobiles).  \nThere is a limitation of EDA that limits its efficiency when sharing\nresources between different mobiles. The limitation is that dynamic\nallocation can only grow \\\"backwards\\\", i.e. if the potentially\ntransmitted slots are in the range \\[*N, M*\\], where 0\u2264 *N*\u2264 *M*\u2264 7,\nthen for slot *k (N* \u2264 *k* \u2264 *M)* to be transmitted, all higher numbered\nslots (i.e. slots *k+1, k+2,...* *M*) must also be transmitted.  \nIn the example, when using EDA, a \\'fair\\' allocation might be to give\nMS2 an allocation starting at slot 0, and MS1 an allocation starting at\nslot 2. This is shown in the top illustration in figure 393. With such\nan allocation it is certain the MS2 can transmit at least 2 timeslots\nwithout blocking or being blocked by MS1. Also, both MS\\'s can\npotentially transmit 4 slots, which is their maximum capability since\nthey are multislot class 12 mobiles. But note that if MS2 transmits even\none slot, then MS1 cannot transmit more then 2 slots without mutual\nblocking; this is an inefficiency of EDA.  \nIn the second part of the illustration the new concept is shown, Back to\nBack Dynamic Allocation (B^2^DA). The new approach is that allocation\ncan proceed in an upward direction for some mobiles, but continue in the\ndownward direction for other mobiles as in the existing standards.  \nIt is easily seen that using this approach the likelihood of one mobile\nblocking the transmissions of the other is reduced; indeed in the\nexample shown, provided both mobiles have three or less slots allocated\nthey cannot block each other. However the number of timeslots required\nhas not been increased; all that is done is to use them more\nefficiently.\n\nInformation 4:\nUplink Allocation needs to be supported. The support of Extended Dynamic\nAllocation is mandatory for mobile stations of multislot classes 22, 24,\n25 and 27, for multislot class type 1 mobile stations that can transmit\non three or more timeslots (either PDCH or TCH), and for mobile stations\nsupporting Flexible Timeslot Assignment (see 3GPP TS 24.008). The\nsupport of Extended Dynamic Allocation for other mobile stations is\noptional and shall be indicated in the MS Radio Access Capability.  \nNOTE: Flexible Timeslot Assignment is applicable only when Extended\nDynamic Allocation is used, or as explicitly indicated for certain RTTI\nconfigurations in 3GPP TS 45.002.  \nThe exclusive allocation shall be used in dual transfer mode during\nuplink operation with a half-rate PDCH.  \nThe network shall ensure that the medium access mode and the resource\nallocation used for a mobile station are compatible with the permitted\nmultislot configurations (see 3GPPTS45.002).\n\nInformation 5:\n(see 3GPP TS 45.002 \\[11\\]).  \nThe channel reservation algorithm can also be implemented on assignment\nbasis. This allows individual MSs to transmit a predetermined amount of\ntime without interruptions.  \nThe MS may be allowed to use the uplink resources as long as there is\nqueued data on the RLC/MAC layer to be sent from the MS. It can comprise\na number of LLC frames. In that sense the radio resources are assigned\non the initially \\\"unlimited\\\" time basis. Alternatively, the uplink\nassignment for each assignment may be limited to a number of radio\nblocks (e.g. in order to offer more fair access to the medium at higher\nloads).  \nThe selective ARQ operation for the acknowledged RLC/MAC mode is\ndescribed in Subclause 6.6.4.5. The unacknowledged RLC/MAC mode\noperation is described in Subclause 6.6.4.6. The non-persistent RLC/MAC\nmode operation is described in Subclause 6.6.4.6a.  \nFigure 25 shows an example of message sequence for the (multislot)\nuplink data transfer with one resource reallocation and possible RLC\ndata block re-transmissions.  \nFigure 25: An example of dynamic allocation uplink data transfer  \n###### 6.6.4.7.2.2 Release of the Resources  \nThe release of the resources allocated for a TBF is normally initiated\nfrom the MS by counting down the last couple of blocks sent for that\nTBF.  \nFor the normal release of resources for RLC connection carrying a mobile\noriginated packet transfer, the mechanism based on acknowledged final\nPacket Uplink Ack/Nack combined with timers is used.  \nAfter the MS has sent its last RLC data block (indicated by the\ncountdown field), the acknowledgement is expected from the network side.\nBy sending the last block, the MS may no longer use the same assignment\nunless a negative acknowledgement arrives. It also means that the\nnetwork side may reassign the same USF(s) to some other user as soon as\nall the RLC data blocks belonging to that Temporary Block Flow are\n\nQuestion: Which wireless resource management class of problems involves allocation of orthogonal, licensed channels to unlicensed users?\nOptions:\noption 1: Class III: Matching with dynamics\noption 2: Class II: Matching with externalities\noption 3: Class I: Canonical matching\noption 4: Class IV: Matching with constraints\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 2: Class II: Matching with externalities\n"

Machine-type\ncommunications is different to current mobile network communication\nservices as it involves:  \na)  different market scenarios,  \nb)  data communications,  \nc)  lower costs and effort,  \nd)  a potentially very large number of communicating terminals with,  \ne)  to a large extent, little traffic per terminal.  \nFor the purpose of the present document, the term MTC is used for the\npurpose to describe use-cases and illustrate the diverse characteristics\nof machine-type communication services.  \nThe informative annex A gives an overview of MTC use-cases which also\nillustrate different overload scenarios which will require overload\ncontrol functions to prevent overload and to differentiate between\nservices offered to different subscribers with different service\nrequirements.

This use case\nresembles the realistic situation in which a utility M2M system\ninteracts with an MNO for consuming cellular technologies. This use case\nfocuses on how 5G can provide improved management related services\noffered to DSOs, in the realistic real-life context. To bring context to\nthis paper, the use case of AMI is used.  \nM2M has existed in DSO networks for a long time. Started with the\nsupport by legacy GPRS, CDMA, UMTS and later LTE, smart metering and AMI\nsystems have enjoyed rapid deployment by a DSO to reach their operation\nand business targets. Not only for metering systems, but also a large\nnumber of DSOs have brought cellular connectivity to substations that\nare remotely located and have relatively less sophisticated Smart Grid\napplications running. For the sake of clear and comprehensive\nexplanation, the architecture with TCP-UDP/IP communication profile from\nthe DLMS/COSEM UA \\[46\\] international standard is referred to, so as to\nelaborate the topic of the hour in truthful context.  \nThe concept is well-known, a device with a cellar module connects to the\ntarget server(s) via cellular connectivity. Figure 5.17.1-1 shows how\nthe utility-adopted DLMS/COSEM standard utilizes this concept.  \n![](media/image21.png){width=\"6.0in\" height=\"3.498611111111111in\"}  \nFigure 5.17.1-1: TCP-UDP/IP profile based utility M2M system\nillustrating a client reporting to two different head-end servers in the\nDSO\\'s data centre \\[50\\].  \nSince the cellular connectivity is provided by an MNO, usually the DSO\nneed to setup a dedicated VPN connection between its own RADIUS server\nand the MNO\\'s RADIUS (as a proxy) to ensure the DSO\\'s own RADIUS\nserver will be responsible for the E2E authentication of the meters or\nthe Smart Grid terminal devices.

The message can be\nMobile Originated Application Terminated (MOAT) and Application\nOriginated Mobile Terminated (AOMT). The MOAT messages can be used by\ndevices for reporting the small data. For example, in environmental\nmonitoring, a monitoring device sends a message to the application\nserver to report the collected data by the sensor every hour. The AOMT\nmessages can be used by an application server to manage or control the\ndevices. For example, in shared bike communication, the application\nserver sends a message to a bike to unlock the bike.  \nOne type of devices need to report data to the application server in a\nscheduled way (e.g. every hour). Another type of devices need to be\nreachable by the application server in a non-scheduled way, e.g. the\nserver updates the configuration of the device. An IoT device that is\npowered by batteries or small solar photovoltaic equipment, needs to\naccess the MSGin5G Service in the whole lifecycle (e.g. 10 years), which\nrequires the MSGin5G Service be very light weight in power consumption.\nThe AOMT messages are time sensitive. The MSGin5G Service needs to\nsupport low latency delivery of AOMT messages.\n\nInformation 5:\nThe typical IoT device communication is sending and receiving small data\nwhich can be delivered just in a message. Today SMS is used as message\nenabler for some IoT applications. However, SMS has limitation in term\nof service capabilities (e.g. 140 bytes payload) and performance (e.g.\nlong latency), in addition, the overhead of control plane resource is\nhigh. There have been enhancements and optimizations on the 3GPP network\ncapabilities to facilitate IoT applications including device triggering,\nsmall data transfer, and Non IP Data Delivery (NIDD) etc.  \nNevertheless, the characteristics of MIoT devices including high density\nconnection, flexible mobility, saving power, limited computing\ncapability, bulk of devices, and traffic pattern of short burst of small\ndata will bring various new demands on message communication, e.g. light\nweight message communication for provision and monitoring, ultra low\nlatency and high reliability message communication for remote control,\nand extremely high resource efficiency for large scale connections.  \nThe MSGin5G Service is basically designed and optimized for massive IoT\ndevice communication including thing-to-thing communication and\nperson-to-thing communication.  \n4.2 Message communication models\n--------------------------------  \n![](media/image3.wmf){width=\"6.297916666666667in\"\nheight=\"3.422222222222222in\"}  \nFigure 4.2 a: The MSGin5G Service overview  \nThe MSGin5G Service is a message enabler for applications.

The patterns of the most effective training data generated from\nthe analytics would be very helpful to improve data collection in order\nto optimize the quantity and quality of the data to be used for\ntraining.  \n##### 5.1.6.2.3 Measurement data correlation analytics for ML training  \nFor ML model training, a large amount of measurement data points may be\ncollected and does not necessarily add value, e.g. due to the complexity\nand time-varying nature of network when the data is collected. Based on\nthe fact that the collected measurement data can be highly correlated\n(linear or non-linear), using all measurement data for model training\n(and inference) can be a waste of computing resources and some means are\ntherefore necessary to optimise the data based on the correlation.

The fact that error events are mutually dependent, would increase\nthe variance of the observed random variable X, and consequently, the\nnumber of samples needed for the confidence required should be\nmultiplied by some factor indicating the number of error events which on\naverage are completely correlated.  \n\u2011 For FERs the events occur so seldom that the events may be regarded as\nindependent (factor of1), the exception being TCH/FS, FACCH, TCH/AxS\nwhich should have a factor of 2.  \n\u2011 Since a convolutional decoder on average will produce burst errors of\nthe order of the constraint length, BERs and RBERs should have a factor\nof 5.  \nGenerally, the situation will be such that a \\\"good\\\" BSS will have a\nperformance Pg which is better than Ps. Consequently, the number of\nsamples found in all cases by (Eq 6) should be multiplied by an\nadditional factor of 2.  \nA.3.2 Gaussian distribution\n---------------------------  \nThe assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the observed random\nvariable X should hold in most cases due to the high number of samples\nused.  \nA.3.3 Stationary random processes\n---------------------------------  \nThe assumption that the error events are outputs of stationary random\nprocesses with identical distributions holds generally for static\npropagation conditions.

This means that all the different\nrandom variables Xi (error events) have a different pi and consequently\ndifferent E(Xi) and Var(Xi). Since all pi are unknown and only the\nrandom variable X, which is the average of all Xi, is observed against a\nsystem requirement Ps, the statistical parameters of (Eq 7) result in\nthe case of multipath propagation conditions assuming that all pi are\nindependent.  \n$E(X) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\\text{pi} = p}$ (Eq 7a)  \n$\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{p}{N} - \\frac{1}{N^{2}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\\text{pi}^{2}$\n(Eq 7b)  \nAlso in this case the variance can (and should) be simplified to p/N if\nall pi are small. However, in this case the second term of (Eq 7b) is\ndominated by the greatest pi and the simplification is less valid than\nfor static propagation conditions. Nevertheless, the needed number of\nsamples given by (Eq 6) is conservative because the variance would\nideally be lower. On the other hand, if the fact that the different pi\nare likely to be correlated with positive correlation is taken into\naccount, Var(X) will increase and the simplification to p/N might be\nadequate.  \nSince under multipath conditions the observed random variable X results\nfrom an average of a set of random processes, we should ensure that the\naverage takes into account a sufficient number of processes to get an\noverall stationary process. Requiring an average over 1000 wavelengths\n(or10000processes if the multipath propagation condition is updated\nevery 10th of a wavelength), the resulting observation period needed is\nindicated in tableA.3-1 if the logical channel in question occupies the\nbasic physical channel all the time.

Extensive system simulations were\nconducted as described in clause 5 to define the interference models,\nwhich were used in the link level characterization to produce the stage\n1 mapping for voice services. There was much to be gained if these voice\nstage 1 mappings could be reused for evaluating data performance,\nprovided of course that the accuracy of the GPRS results were not\ncompromized. That the voice mapping can be reused is definitely the case\nfor the FTP/MMS data traffic model since the characteriztics are very\nsimilar to a circuit-switched voice connection. However, this conclusion\nhad to be verified for the web traffic model.  \nIn \\[17\\] system level simulations were conducted, which showed that the\nstatistics of a combination of voice and web-browsing data users were\nquite similar to the voice-only statistics for network configuration 3\nat 40% FL.

For example, it shows that\nauthentication relay attacks are a subset of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)\nattacks. Note that the attack taxonomy tree itself is not an attack tree\nby classic definition.  \nThis attack taxonomy allows understanding what attacks are possible,\nwhat attacks can be mitigated by a particular protection, and what\nattacks remain even with new security protections.  \nFor example, this attack taxonomy can serve as a tool to track which\ncountermeasures or solutions would need to be implemented together in\norder to mitigate those attack vectors with a high risk. We know that an\nattacker is not bound to one particular path of attack, but usually\nchooses whichever way is easiest to achieve its goal.  \nB.2 Attack taxonomy\n===================  \nThe attacks against 5G UEs over radio interfaces can be classified into\ntwo categories, active attacks and passive attacks. In active attacks,\nan attacker actively injects signal or messages to influence what UE\nwould receive. In passive attacks, an attacker silently sniffs signals\nexchanged between a UE and a gNB.  \nFor the convenience of reference, we assign a number to each attack in\nthe attack taxonomy tree. In attack description, an active attack is\nprefixed with \"A-\" and a passive attack is prefixed with \"P-\". This can\nhelp distinguish an attack number from a clause number.  \nEditor Note: the attacks in Figure X.2-1 consists of threats identified\nin this TR and other threats that either have been addressed in 5G\n(e.g., with SUPI encryption and UPIP) or being studied in other TRs. How\nto further differentiate these types of threats in the Figure is FFS.  \nThe root node of the attack taxonomy tree is the general category of all\nattacks under consideration. A leaf node is an actual attack.

Thus, the HTTP request for a\ncertain quality results in a multiple HTTP request for each of the\nmentioned layers and all requests for a single content incorporate at\nleast the base layer representation. Consequently, the probability of a\ncache-hit for files containing the lowest layers of SVC streams, which\nmost of the users are interested in, is increased.  \nNote that requesting multiple layers for each segment could be done in\ntwofold manner. One is within one single TCP connection requesting each\nlayer after the other. The first approach (single TCP connection)\nintroduces additional buffering requirement (for lower layer segments)\nat the clients, in addition to the playout delay, since client has to\nwait until highest layer segment is received before playout can start.\nAnother possibility could be to setup parallel TCP connections. The\nsecond approach (parallel TCP connections) would reduce (but not\neliminate) this buffering and playout delay but introduces additional\nHTTP overhead (new connection per layer). The simulation results analyze\nthe effect of different video codings on the caching efficiency.\nTherefore, the impact on the buffering requirements at the clients and\nthe additional HTTP overhead is not considered here.  \n##### 6.1.3.7.4 Caching Algorithm  \nThe performance of the cache is here analyzed for two different caching\nalgorithms (operating on chunks):  \n> \u2022 LRU: where the most recently requested chunks are kept in the cache.\n>\n> \u2022 CC: An algorithm described in \\[1\\] that takes into account the\n> number of guaranteed hits of chunks (if the HTTP streaming client\n\nInformation 2:\n### 6.13.1 Introduction  \nIt is proposed that the potential benefits of using DASH-aware caches\nare studied as part of the work done for completing the study item. The\nimproved DASH operation with proxy caches may involve additional\nsignalling between DASH clients and proxy caches. As compatibility with\nthe existing HTTP infrastructure is one of the greatest advantages of\nDASH, we propose that any additional signalling that is proposed be\ncompatible with HTTP 1.1 and existing HTTP cache implementations in a\nsense that existing HTTP caches will ignore that additional signalling.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 6.13.3 Gap Analysis and Problem Statement  \nFor the analysis of the use cases the following assumptions are\nconsidered:  \n\\- The cache operation adheres to some specific rules, e.g. that objects\nare cached and deleted based on popularity and previous requests.  \n\\- It is assumed that the round trip delay between UE and origin server\nis significantly longer that the round trip delay between UE and cache\nserver.  \n\\- It is assumed that the content provider produces a large number of\nrepresentations in this use case.  \nWhen the end-to-end system architecture includes a proxy cache, the time\nfor fetching the segment directly from the proxy cache is smaller than\nthe time for the fetching the segment from the origin server. It is\nespecially true in case the network delivery capacity from a remote\nnetwork element (the origin server or other proxy cache) to the HTTP\nproxy cache selected by the DASH player is much lower than the network\ndelivery capacity from the HTTP proxy cache selected by the DASH player\nto the DASH client. Here, the network delivery capacity not only depends\non the bandwidths in the delivery network but also depends on the Round\nTrip Time (RTT) and receiver advertised window as those affect the\nachievable HTTP/TCP throughput.  \nThe DASH client may suffer from slow playback startup if the requested\nsegment is not cached especially in the case that segment duration is\nrelatively long and either the content has not been prepared for or the\nclient is not capable of subsegment-based rate adaptation.  \nThe proxy cache may cache multiple Representations of an Media\nPresentation (MP) if other DASH clients requested the same MP through\nthe proxy cache. The content provider may provide a large number of\nRepresentations for some popular MP to support hierarchically bandwidth\ndistribution in a large number of DASH clients. The number of\nRepresentations and the completeness of Representations of an MP cached\n\nInformation 4:\nthe available storing capacity of the cache when a single layer codec is\nconsidered, whereas when SVC is used the available resources are much\nmore efficiently used. Furthermore, the hit-ratio increases due to the\nfact that many users make requests for the same data since, even though\nthey may be interested in different version of the same video, their\nrequests are split into multiple request, one associated with each layer\nthat they are requesting. Since the layers built on top of each other, a\nuser requesting layer ***k***, needs to request layer 1 to ***k-1***\ntoo. In particular the base layer is requested by everyone.  \nSince the difference between both AVC and SVC are more disparate for\nthis case we have conducted the simulations for a higher range of values\nfor cache capacity (***C***) only focusing on the LRU caching algorithm,\nleading to the results shown in Figure 64.  \n![](media/image75.wmf){width=\"3.325in\" height=\"2.588888888888889in\"}  \nFigure 64: Congestion due to heavy cross traffic  \nIn this figure, the cache-hit-ratio over cache capacity is depicted. It\ncan clearly be seen how the use of SVC improves the performance of the\nsystem in terms of cache-hit-ratio compared to the use of MR-VoD. It is\nalso noticeable that the cache-hit-ratio for the AVC case is even lower\nthan for the highest layer (layer 4) when SVC is used almost for all\ncache capacity values, since the storage capacity at the cache runs out\nfaster with the higher diversity in requested files due to using the\nMR-VoD approach. Furthermore, the caching performance for the base layer\nis significantly higher compared to the other files and layers as the\nnumber of request for this is higher than for the other layers or\ndifferent representations when AVC is considered.  \nThe increased cache hit ratio leads to an reduced traffic through the\n\\\"transit\\\" link, which is shown in Figure 65 for SVC-VoD and MR-VoD for\nheavy cross traffic and LRU algorithm.\n\nInformation 5:\ncapacity is measured in media units, which are equivalent to the file\nsize of a content item of 90 minutes with a single view at the lowest\nquality. A cache capacity range from 50 up to 9800 media units is\nsimulated in order to cover a wide operational area and reasonable cache\nperformance.  \n![](media/image22.wmf){width=\"5.692361111111111in\"\nheight=\"2.2131944444444445in\"}  \nFigure 20: Requests characteristics for the period of 31 days.  \n#### 6.2.3.4 Simulation results  \nThe results shown in figure 21 depict the difference between the use of\nH.264/AVC and the three MVC variants (MVC-20, MVC-30 and MVC-40) in\nterms of caching performance. It can be observed that the use of MVC\nleads to an increase of cache hit ratio with respect to H.264/AVC,\nbecause more content items can be stored in a cache of the same size.\nThis is due to the fact that all second view representations are encoded\nwith significantly smaller bitrates on average when using MVC compared\nto H.264/AVC. Figure 22 shows the absolute increase in cache hit ratio\nshown when using MVC with respect to H.264/AVC for the three MVC\nvariants. The increase grows linearly with the MVC gain of encoding the\ndependent second view.  \n![](media/image23.wmf){width=\"3.9375in\" height=\"2.952777777777778in\"}  \nFigure 21: Cache hit ratio of the MVC encodings with respect to\nH.264/AVC  \n![](media/image24.wmf){width=\"3.9375in\" height=\"2.952777777777778in\"}  \nFigure 22: Absolute cache hit ratio increase of MVC encodings with\nrespect to H.264/AVC  \nThe higher cache hit ratio when using MVC makes it more likely for UEs\nto be served from the cache rather than from the content server. This is\nreflected in a reduction of traffic on the transit link that connects\nthe content server with the 3GPP network. The average transit link\ntraffic is shown in figure 23. Figure 24 shows the relative reduction of\ntransit link traffic with respect to H.264/AVC for the three MVC\nvariants. As can be seen from the figure, the MVC-30 coding leads to a\n\nQuestion: What is the optimum caching strategy for static user terminals?\nOptions:\noption 1: No caching\noption 2: Cache popular files\noption 3: Cache all files\noption 4: Cache files at random\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 2: Cache popular files\n"

These UEs\nhave registered with a PLMN and operate in a federation to perform\nfederated learning tasks.  \nThe federated learning service provider \"Avian\" organizes the work of\nthese UEs so that repeated iterations of training will occur over time.  \nIt is assumed that the UEs provide federated learning input using the\nsame network resources (e.g. network slice) and that the policy for this\nnetwork communication is distinct from the policy for other activities\nthat the UE performs. In this way, the network can adjust the QoS policy\nfor federated learning communication for individual UEs without any\nservice impact except to the federated learning service.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 6.23.1 Description  \nModel training using Federated learning is useful in scenarios where\ndata may not be easily collected from Data Producer NF. For example,\nthere may be data privacy/data security requirements where data\ncollection from data producer NFs is not feasible or there can be high\nsignalling load if data is collected from Data Producer NFs that have\nlimited resources available (e.g. NFs supporting a local edge network).  \nFederated learning solves this problem by locally training an ML model\nusing data that are locally available and distributing local model\nparameters to a central model training function that aggregates the\nmodel parameters and generates a central ML model.  \nThe following architecture is proposed to support model training using\nfederated learning.  \nFigure 6.23.1-1: Architecture supporting model training using federated\nlearning  \nThe main functions of the federated learning architecture is as follows:  \n\\- A central MTLF (that supports FL aggregation) that configures one or\nmore local MTLF(s) (that supports FL participation) with the data that\nare required to be collected from one or more (local) Data Producer NFs\nand generates an aggregated ML model based on ML model parameters\nreceived from an ML model trained locally from each local MTLF.  \n\\- One or more local MTLF(s) that support ML model training by\ncollecting data from one or more Data Producer NFs available locally.  \n\\- A central Analytics Logical Function (AnLF) that discovers the\nCentral MTLF supporting federated learning for model training since not\nall MTLFs will support Model Training using federated learning. The AnLF\ncan discover the central MTLF on per Analytic ID/Analytic Filter\ninformation basis. The NRF includes information in the NF profile\nwhether an MTLF support FL aggregation or FL participation.  \nOnce the AnLF discovers the Central MTLF that supports FL aggregation,\nthe AnLF will request an ML model for an Analytic ID including ML model\n\nInformation 3:\n### 7.4.1 Description  \nA new'service enabler' is introduced that allows a service provider to\nachieve effective performance for the entire group of devices. The term\n'Flock' stands for a group that has performance requirements that\nconsider the performance 'as a team' as opposed to the 'total' or\nresults of the 'best performers.'  \nThe example of a Flock provided in this use case (an application of this\nservice enabler) is for Synchronous Federated Learning. Please note that\n\"Flocking\" is a **general service enabler.** Synchronous Federated\nLearning is discussed here because (a) it is a concrete application of\nthe \"Flocking\" service enabler, (b) the topic of this study is model and\nAI data set communication. To explain and motivate \"Flocking\" we need an\nexample, and fortunately this application is directly within the scope\nof the FS\\_AMMT study.  \nSynchronous federated learning involves a set of contributing terminals,\nas described in clause 7 of this TR. In a federation, a hierarchy exists\nthat provides an effective delegation of work and information. This\nfederation functions as if it were a single (non-federated) system to\nthe extent that the distributed components can operate within the same\nexpectations. For synchronous federated learning some number of the\nfederation's components lag, these become stragglers. Information and\nfunction availability of the whole federation suffers when the\nperformance of individual components fall significantly behind the\nothers as the entire group should complete the iteration.  \nSynchronous federated learning works best by eliminating bias --\nallowing diverse users and devices to participate and bring to the\nlearning task diversity of input data, as the users will have different\nattributes. It is important not to merely focus on the 'best performing\ndevices' in the federation and drop the rest. It may increase the\nperformance in terms of time to iterate the synchronous federated\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.69.1 Description  \nThis solution addresses aspects of key issue \\#8 on the following\naspects related to the key issue \\#8:  \n\\- How to decide whether Federated Learning is required or not?  \n\\- Whether and how to perform model performance monitoring of the NWDAF\nFederated Learning operation?  \n\\- How to coordinate multiple NWDAFs including selection of participant\nNWDAF instances in the Federated Learning group?  \nThe service may vary in different network areas, which leads to\ndifferent data characteristics (i.e. data distribution) of the local\ndataset in different MTLFs for model training. If a MTLF has not enough\ndataset for training a model with required accuracy level from the AnLF,\nhorizontal federated learning is required. An AI/ML model trained using\ndata from network areas could be utilized in a network area served by\nthe AnLF without experiencing performance degradation, if the\ncharacteristics of data used by the AnLF in its serving area are same or\nsimilar with the characteristics of the dataset used by the MTLFs\njoining the Federated Learning.  \nBefore each iteration of Federated Learning, the FL server MTLF will\ndeliver the common model (i.e. the shared initial model of each\niteration of Federated Learning) to each FL client MTLF. The FL client\nMTLFs use the training datasets as the validity datasets to calculate\nthe Accuracy-in-Training of the common model. The Accuracy-in-Training\nis to indicate the performance of ML model by comparing prediction with\nlabel data in validation dataset reserved from training dataset. The\nAccuracy-in-Use is to indicate the performance of ML model used in live\nnetwork by comparing the result of inference with the observed label\ndata, i.e. ground truth from the live network collected in history.

It has also been adapted to represent the\nflattened ear of a wireless device user.  \nFor DUT radiated performance measurements in \\\"intended use\\\" position\nSAM head phantom without a shoulder section will be used.  \nThe shell of the SAM phantom should be made of low-loss material (loss\ntangent less than 0.05) with low permittivity (less than 5). The\nthickness has to be 2.0\u00b10.2mm in the areas close to the handset in\n\\\"intended use\\\" position.  \nThe phantom has to be filled with tissue simulating liquid. It is\nrecommended to use one of the typical SAR tissue simulating liquids and\nAppendix B gives four example recipes of such liquids. It is also\nrecommended to verify the RF properties of the liquid with suitable\nequipment. The values should be maintained within 15% of the values\nrelative permittivity 40 (\u00b115%) and sigma 1.4 (\u00b115%) at 1900 MHz.

Also, it is required that the continuation of QoS provision be\npossible whilst moving within an AIPN including when moving across\naccess systems during handover. It is also required to provide QoS\ncontrol for multicast (e.g. user-to-multicast) traffic.  \nThe QoS ensuring methods have to consider cost aspects. Therefore, it is\nvery important to support a variety of QoS ensuring methods, cost\neffective and adapted to the operator needs. Different operators have\ndifferent cost structures, i.e. multiple QoS ensuring methods may need\nto be supported in the end-to-end path. This may be also valid in a\nsingle operator case due to different cost structures of the different\nnetwork parts.  \nRecommended requirements:  \n\\- It shall be possible to guarantee end-to-end QoS for a user-to-user\nor multicast (e.g. user-to-multicast) session between AIPNs. This\nincludes the case where more than one network administration is involved\nin the provision of the end-to-end service.  \n> \\- It shall be possible to support different QoS ensuring methods\n> within the same AIPN and between different AIPNs.  \n\\- Interworking between different QoS ensuring methods in the end-to-end\npath has to be supported.  \n\\- QoS considerations need to be taken into account in handover\ndecisions:  \n\\- It shall be possible for AIPN to guarantee end-to-end QoS without\nmodification when the terminal or session moves from one access system\nto another, if the target access system supports the required QoS.  \n\\- It shall be possible for AIPN to guarantee end-to-end QoS, with QoS\nmodification, when the terminal or session moves from one access system\n\nInformation 5:\nneed to optimize the resource efficiency for such scenario.  \nAdditional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the various\nKPIs defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be achieved\nby optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small\ndata transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane resources\nutilization include in-network caching and application in a Service\nHosting Environment closer to the end user.

The purpose of ML validation is to\nevaluate the performance of the ML entity when performing on the\nvalidation data, and to identify the variance of the performance on the\ntraining data and the validation data. If the variance is not\nacceptable, the entity would need to be tuned (re-trained) before being\nmade available to the consumer and used for inference.  \nThe training data and validation data are normally split from the same\ndata set with a certain ratio in terms of the quantity of the data\nexamples, therefore they have the same pattern. The training data set is\nused to create (fine-tune) the ML entity, while the validation data set\nis used to qualify performance of the trained entity.  \n#### 5.1.2.2 Use cases  \n##### 5.1.2.2.1 ML entity validation performance reporting  \nIn the ML training, the ML entity is generated based on the learning\nfrom the training data and validated using validation data. The\nperformance of the ML entity has tight dependency on the data (i.e.\ntraining data) from which the ML entity is generated. Therefore, an ML\nentity performing well on the training data may not necessarily perform\nwell on other data e.g. while conducting inference. If the performance\nof ML entity is not good enough as result of ML validation, the ML\nentity will be tuned (re-trained) and validated again. The process of ML\nentity generation and validation is repeated by the ML training\nfunction, until the performance of the ML entity meets the expectation\non both training data and validation data. The producer in the end\nselects one or more ML entities with the best level performance on both\ntraining data and validation data as the result of the ML training, and\nreports to the consumer. The performance of each selected ML entity on\nboth training data and validation data also needs to be reported.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 4.3.1 AI/ML operational workflow  \nAI/ML techniques are widely used in 5GS (including 5GC, NG-RAN and\nmanagement system), and the generic workflow of the operational steps in\nthe lifecycle of an ML model or entity, is depicted in the figure\n4.3.1-1.  \nFigure 4.3.1-1: AI/ML operational workflow  \nThe workflow involves 3 main phases; the training, deployment and\ninference phase, including the main operational tasks for each phase.\nThese are briefly described below:  \n**Training phase:**  \n**- ML Training:** Learning by the Machine from the training data to\ngenerate the (new or updated) ML entity (see 3GPP TS 28.105 \\[4\\]) that\ncould be used for inference. The ML Training may also include the\nvalidation of the generated ML entity to evaluate the performance\nvariance of the ML entity when performing on the training data and\nvalidation data. If the validation result does not meet the expectation\n(e.g. the variance is not acceptable), the ML entity needs to be\nre-trained. This is the initial step of the workflow. The ML Training\nMnS is specified in 3GPP TS 28.105 \\[4\\].  \n**- ML Testing:** Testing of the validated ML entity with testing data\nto evaluate the performance of the trained ML entity for selection for\ninference. When the performance of the trained ML entity meets the\nexpectations on both training data and validation data, the ML entity is\nfinally tested to evaluate the performance on testing data. If the\ntesting result meets the expectation, the ML entity may be counted as a\ncandidate for use towards the intended use case or task, otherwise the\nML entity may need to be further (re)trained. In some cases, the ML\nentity may need to be verified which is the special case of testing to\ncheck whether it works in the AI/ML inference function or the target\nnode. In other cases, the verification step may be skipped, for instance\nin case the input and output data, data types and formats, have been\nunchanged from the last ML entity.  \n**Deployment phase:**\n\nInformation 3:\n| performance score    |                      |                      |\n| for ML training, the |                      |                      |\n| data set is the      |                      |                      |\n| training data set.   |                      |                      |\n+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n\nInformation 4:\n### 5.3.1 Trustworthy Machine Learning  \n#### 5.3.1.1 Description  \nDuring ML training, testing and inference, the AI/ML trustworthiness\nmanagement is needed. Based on the risk level (e.g.unacceptable, high,\nminimal) of the use case, the trustworthiness requirements for ML\ntraining, testing and inference may vary and therefore the related\ntrustworthiness mechanisms need to be configured and monitored. The\npurpose of AI/ML trustworthiness is to ensure that the model being\ntrained, tested, and deployed is explainable, fair and robust.  \nNOTE: In the context of SA5, explainability of a model refers to\nexplaining individual decisions predicted by the model and not\nexplaining the internal behavior of the model itself.  \nThe EU has proposed an AI regulation act for AI/ML consisting of several\nkey requirements that the AI/ML systems should meet (based on the risk\nlevel of the use case) for them to be considered trustworthy \\[10\\].\nThese requirements include, but not limited to human agency and\noversight, technical robustness and safety, privacy and data governance,\ntransparency, diversity, non-discrimination and fairness,\naccountability, societal and environmental well-being. Other\nrequirements and more details on each of these requirements are\ndescribed in \\[11\\]. Furthermore, ISO/IEC analyses the factors that can\nimpact the trustworthiness of systems providing or using AI and possible\napproaches or requirements to improving their trustworthiness that can\nbe used by any business regardless of its size or sector \\[12\\].  \nThree well known categories under the umbrella of Trustworthy Machine\nLearning are as follows:  \n**Explainable Machine Learning:** Explainability in machine learning\nrefers to the ability of ML models to enable humans to understand\ndecisions or predictions made by them.  \n**Fair Machine Learning:** Fairness in machine learning refers to the\nprocess of correcting and eliminating bias in machine learning models.\n\nInformation 5:\nData used for training                     This parameter provides information on the actual data and data sources that have been used for the (re-)training of the ML model. It also provides information on the granularity of the used input data, the extend (e.g. duration, scope) of the data, the sampling ratio, and the partitioning criteria, if applicable.\n\\> Granularity of input data               The granularity of input data that will be used for inference may be expressed as minimum sampling ratio, maximum time interval, and/or total number of input values.\nTarget environment capacity requirements   The information about the target environment capacity requirements includes, e.g. the computational capacity and the memory that will be available when performing inference with this model.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of cross-validation in machine learning?\nOptions:\noption 1: To compare the performance of different models during hyperparameter optimization\noption 2: To improve the training accuracy of the model\noption 3: To evaluate the performance of the model on multiple train-test splits\noption 4: To validate the accuracy of the training process\noption 5: To determine the best combination of features for training the model\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 3: To evaluate the performance of the model on multiple train-test splits\n"

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nThree types of time variant parameters are often used to provide message\ntimeliness or uniqueness, including *random numbers*, *sequence\nnumbers*, and *timestamps*.  \nA random number is often used in real-time interactive communication,\nsuch as a challenge-response authentication protocol, to ensure a\nresponse is uniquely computed based on a specific challenge. Since\nsystem information is not acquired by UE interactively with gNB, a\nrandom number is not suitable for providing message timeliness in system\ninformation.  \nA sequence number, either a serial number or incremental counter value,\ncan uniquely identify a message. To use a sequence number to detect\nreplay attack, a recipient needs to receive each and every message from\nan originator (e.g., gNB) and also maintains a state (e.g., the latest\nsequence number) for the originator. These requirements do not hold in\nsystem information broadcasting, since a UE does not acquire every\nsystem information block from every gNB. Thus, sequence number is not\nsuitable for detecting replayed system information.  \nTimestamp can be included with a message to provide message timeliness\nto mitigate replay attacks. It does not require any state to be stored\nby a recipient but requires the local clocks of a message originator and\na recipient to loosely synchronize. Given that a UE synchronizes its\nclock with a gNB prior to acquiring system information, we suggest that\nit is reasonable to assume the clocks between UE and gNB can be loosely\nsynchronized. Therefore, a timestamp is recommended for mitigating\nreplay attacks.  \n**D8: A timestamp is included with each SIB, and is digitally signed\nalong with the SIB to mitigate replay attacks.**  \nA UE can check a timestamp in a SIB against its local time to see if the\ntime difference is within an allowed window (t\\_w). The smaller the t\\_w\nis, the more likely a replay can be detected.  \nEditor's Note: Further clarification on which one is accurate between\n\nInformation 2:\nreceived at one DS-TT and exits the 5GS at another DS-TT. Therefore, a\nfilter may be located at the DS-TT or at the entity where the message is\nrerouted.  \n######### Annex C: Asymmetric delay attacks  \nC.1 Introduction\n================  \nThe possibility of an attacker delaying packets in one direction and by\nthis introducing an asymmetric delay has been described in several\nresearch papers \\[8\\], \\[9\\], \\[10\\] and is also mentioned in \\[7\\].\nThis annex documents the issues with such attacks.  \nC.2 Calculation of offset between clocks\n========================================  \nUsually symmetric channel delays apply when PTP uses different event\nmessages to synchronize the time between two ports, whereas each port is\nattached to a clock. This clock can be a boundary clock (which is\nusually a consuming TSN end station with 1 port) or an ordinary clock\n(which have at least 2 ports and forward the time) (5GS works as a\ntransparent clock). Also, one of the clocks can be attached to a Grand\nmaster clock (which can be in 5GS or outside).  \nThe calculation of the offset between clocks is based on the assumption\nthat the channel delay in both directions (i.e. master to slave and\nslave to master) is symmetric (i.e. the time a message needs to traverse\nfrom one port to another is the equal). If this assumption holds, PTP\ntime synchronization is highly accurate.  \nC.3 Delay attacks on time synchronisation messages\n==================================================  \nAn attacker having the possibility to delay packets, e.g. via ARP\nspoofing (Ethernet), BGP hijacking (IP) or a compromised in-path device\nor clock, can introduce an asymmetric delay (i.e. different delay for\nmaster to slave and slave to master). This delay can be deterministic or\nrandom.  \nThere are two types of such asymmetric delay attacks: asymmetric\nselective message delay and asymmetric channel delay attacks:  \n\\- In asymmetric selective message delay attacks, the attacker performs\n\nInformation 3:\n\\[4\\] 3GPP TR 23.700-20: \\\"Study on enhanced support of Industrial\nInternet of Things (IIoT) in the 5G System (5GS)\\\".  \n\\[5\\] IEEE 802.1Qcc: \\\"IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area\nNetworks\\--Bridges and Bridged Networks \\-- Amendment 31: Stream\nReservation Protocol (SRP) Enhancements and Performance Improvements\\\".  \n\\[6\\] Void  \n\\[7\\] IETF RFC 7384: \\\"Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet\nSwitched Networks\\\".  \n\\[8\\] Robert Annessi, Joachim Fabini, Felix Iglesias, and Tanja Zseby:\n\\\"Encryption is Futile: Delay Attacks on High-Precision Clock\nSynchronization\\\"; <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08569.pdf>.  \n\\[9\\] Sergio Barreto; Aswin Suresh; Jean-Yves Le Boudec: \\\"Cyber-attack\non Packet-Based Time Synchronization Protocols: the Undetectable Delay\nBox\\\"; published in: 2016 IEEE International Instrumentation and\nMeasurement Technology Conference Proceedings;\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7520408.  \n\\[10\\] Markus Ullmann; Matthias V\u00f6geler: \\\"Delay Attacks - Implication\non NTP and PTP Time Synchronization\\\"; published in: 2009 International\nSymposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control\nand Communication;\n<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5340224/>.  \n\\[11\\] IETF RFC 6749: \\\"OAuth2.0 Authorization Framework\\\".  \n3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations\n=================================================  \n3.1 Terms\n---------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the terms given in\nTR21.905\\[1\\] and the following apply.

For this attack, an\nattacker needs to perform traffic analysis to identify the\nsynchronization messages for delay.  \n\\- In asymmetric channel delay attacks, messages transmitted over the\nfull channel are delayed in one direction. Due to this, the PTP offset\ncalculation becomes wrong and the clocks could start to be not\nsynchronized properly anymore.  \nThe impact of these attacks can be DoS, accuracy degradation and false\ntimes being synchronized.  \nIn contrast, if synchronisation messages are symmetrically delayed as\ndescribed in clause C.2, an attacker delaying by purpose cannot degrade\naccuracy, because the same delay happens in both directions.  \nC.4 Considerations\n==================  \nThis annex documents the issue of asymmetric delay attacks. As 5GS works\nas a transparent bridge, the countermeasures are out of 3GPP scope.  \nAs reported in \\[8\\], \\[9\\], \\[10\\], encryption has been elaborated as\none measure to harden the synchronization against selective message\ndelay attacks, as it could become more complex for an attacker to\nperform traffic analysis on the channel communication.  \n######### Annex D: Change history  \n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n| **C   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| hange |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| hist  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| ory** |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n| **D   | *     | **T   | *     | **    | **    | **Su  | **New |\n| ate** | *Meet | Doc** | *CR** | Rev** | Cat** | bject | vers  |\n|       | ing** |       |       |       |       | /Comm | ion** |\n\nQuestion: Why are timing attacks alarming?\nOptions:\noption 1: They come from a completely unexpected direction\noption 2: They are a ciphertext-only attack\noption 3: They can determine a private key by tracking timing information\noption 4: All of the above\noption 5: None of the above\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: All of the above\n"

For this purpose, the specification TS 23.501 \\[3\\]\nwas developed, based on the conclusions of the Rel-14 study item\nFS\\_NextGen and related TR 23.799 \\[6\\].  \nTS 23.501 covers the 5G System architecture that is defined to support\ndata connectivity and services enabling deployments to use techniques\nsuch as Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networking.\nThe 5G System architecture leverages service-based interactions between\nControl Plane (CP) Network Functions where identified. Some key\nprinciples and concept are to:  \n\\- Separate the User Plane (UP) functions from the Control Plane (CP)\nfunctions, allowing independent scalability, evolution and flexible\n\nInformation 3:\ndownload and image or video clip upload) typically gain from increased\nmean bit rates, but also gain from reduced latency, e.g. throughput is\nlimited by the TCP window size divided by the round trip time.  \n\\- Conversational services (like Voice over IP (VoIP) and enhanced Push\nto talk over Cellular (PoC)), as well as, e.g. on-line gaming services\ntypically have high requirements on latency and fast access.  \n\\- All services may gain from improved coverage, e.g. video-telephony is\na service that will need (better) coverage for higher bit rates for both\nuplink and downlink.  \n\\- All services may gain from a mobile station always being connected to\nthe most appropriate base station, i.e. as seen from a radio performance\nperspective, as this may yield higher capacity, reduce latency etc. due\nto improved interference conditions.  \n\\- Particular requirements may be set by services like broadcast TV over\nMBMS bearers. Typically, high bit rates are required at the same time as\nrobustness is important to fulfil coverage and latency requirements as\nwell as providing interactivity.  \nA GSM/EDGE network may interoperate with WCDMA RAT, either within an\noperator\\'s network or with different operators. There are also\nstandalone GSM/EDGE networks. Both the GSM/WCDMA networks and the GSM\nonly networks will benefit from the increased GSM/EDGE service\nportfolio. A combined WCDMA & GSM/EDGE network will benefit from better\nservice continuity between the accesses resulting in an easier resource\nutilisation and service provisioning. GSM/EDGE only networks can give\ntheir users an increased range of end user services/applications and\npossibly make use of applications/services that do not require\nadaptations to access specific capabilities. This could potentially lead\nto reduce cost of provisioning and create a wider use of services.  \nAs a general guideline, the following subclauses detail the performance\nrequirements and design constraints the proposed features/candidates\n\nInformation 4:\n### 6.21.1 Description  \nThe increased density of access nodes needed to meet future performance\nobjectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and acquiring\nspectrum and antenna locations.

This could also include information that is normally\nexchanged during the Advertisement/Discovery phase, and which could lead\nto a re-iteration of the Network Composition process or even the request\nto de-compose.  \n![](media/image25.wmf){width=\"2.970138888888889in\"\nheight=\"2.3333333333333335in\"}  \nFigure 23: The principal Composition Process.  \n6.2 Decomposition Process\n-------------------------  \nDecomposition is a process, which can be seen as \"inverse function\" of\nthe Composition Process. The Decomposition Process will restore the\nstates of decomposing CCNs to their original state before CCNs composed.\nAdditionally, all information produced during a Network Composition\nrequiring further processing such as a charging info should be exchanged\nbetween decomposing CCNs. Unlike the Composition process, Decomposition\ndoes not always require or allow coordination between participating\nCCNs, because once a CCN has indicated its willingness to leave a\nNetwork Composition, if Decomposition fails due to some reason,\ndecomposing CCNs should be able to recover from an interrupted\nDecomposition Process.  \nThe interrupted Decomposition Process shall never leave the decomposing\nCCNs into an unstable state, thus a CCN can always restore control of\nthe resources it had before the Decomposition started or before Network\nComposition according to the CA. For example, in case of\n\\\"uncoordinated\\\" Decomposition, the decomposing CCNs would restore\ncontrol of the resources they had before they composed, since they are\n\nInformation 5:\nHorowitz, and William J Dally. \"EIE: efficient inference engine on\ncompressed deep neural network\", In 43rd International Symposium on\nComputer Architecture, IEEE Press, 243--254.  \n\\[36\\] V.

If and\nhow to extend Network Performance Analytics and which input data to use\nwill be discussed in normative phase.  \n\\- Overall Average and Maximum Packet Delay for UL/DL per UE per time\nwindow;  \n\\- Overall Average and Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL/DL per UE per\ntime window;  \n\\- Overall Average, Minimum and Maximum Traffic rate for UL/DL per UE\nper time window.  \n\\- Principle 5: The AF selects one of the ADT policies provided by PCF\nwhich may most fit for its requirement and indicate it to the PCF.  \n\\- The Application traffic could be non GBR type or GBR type. The AF can\nprovide Alternative QoS profile(s) for GBR flows only.  \nSecond step - Application Data Transmission:  \n\\- When the Application AI/ML begins e.g. to transport intermediate\ndata, local training data, inference results, or model performance data,\nthrough 5GS, the AF can leverage the either existing service\nNnef\\_AFsessionWithQoS\\_Create request message as described in\n\nInformation 3:\n### 5.3.5 Intent driven network optimization scenario  \n#### 5.3.5.1 Pre-condition  \nThe operator wants to optimize the network to satisfy certain user\nexperience related performance requirements (e.g. the percentage of\nusers with low experienced data rate (e.g. \\<5 Mbps) should be less\nthan certain value (e.g. 1%), the average experienced data rate should\nbe greater than 7 Mbps).  \n#### 5.3.5.2 Description  \nDue to some user complaint information received, the operator as MnS\nConsumer expresses his intent that the network in the specified area\nneeds to be optimized to satisfy certain user experience related\nperformance requirements (e.g. the percentage of users with low\nexperienced data rate (e.g. \\< 5 Mbps) should be less than certain value\n(e.g. 1%), the average experienced data rate should be greater than 7\nMbps).  \nBased on the intent received, the MnS Producer detects the potential\nnetwork issues which lead to this poor user experience related\nperformance requirements (e.g. low experienced data rate (e.g.\n\\<5Mbps)), for example, the handover is happened frequently between\nsome neighbour Cells, some weak coverage area with large number of\nusers, etc.  \nThe MnS Producer decides the network optimization method (e.g. CCO, HO,\nmachine learning, etc) to be used and derives the corresponding\nrequirements (e.g. policy for HO) for the selected network optimization\nmethod. For example, MnS Producer decide to trigger coverage and\ncapacity optimization to enhance the coverage for the weak areas and\ntrigger the handover optimization to reduce the frequency of handover\nbetween certain neighbour Cells. Another example, MnS producer may\nconfigure admission control policies for the RAN Node(s) in the\nspecified area to ensure the user experience related performance\nrequirements.  \nMnS Producer adjust and monitor the network iteratively until the\nspecified user experience related performance requirements are\nsatisfied.\n\nInformation 4:\nthe 5G System. All traffic mapped to the same 5G QoS Flow receive the\nsame forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue management\npolicy, rate shaping policy, RLC configuration, etc.). Providing\ndifferent QoS forwarding treatment requires separate 5G QoS Flow.  \n**5G QoS Identifier:** A scalar that is used as a reference to a\nspecific QoS forwarding behaviour (e.g. packet loss rate, packet delay\nbudget) to be provided to a 5G QoS Flow. This may be implemented in the\naccess network by the 5QI referencing node specific parameters that\ncontrol the QoS forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission\nthresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer protocol\nconfiguration, etc.).  \n**Access Traffic Steering:** The procedure that selects an access\nnetwork for a new data flow and transfers the traffic of this data flow\nover the selected access network. Access traffic steering is applicable\nbetween one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Access Traffic Switching:** The procedure that moves all traffic of an\nongoing data flow from one access network to another access network in a\nway that maintains the continuity of the data flow. Access traffic\nswitching is applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Access Traffic Splitting:** The procedure that splits the traffic of a\ndata flow across multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is\napplied to a data flow, some traffic of the data flow is transferred via\none access and some other traffic of the same data flow is transferred\nvia another access. Access traffic splitting is applicable between one\n3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.  \n**Application detection filter:** A logic used to detect packets\ngenerated by an application based on extended inspection of these\npackets, e.g., header and/or payload information, as well as dynamics of\npacket flows. The logic is entirely internal to a UPF, and is out of\nscope of this specification.\n\nInformation 5:\non the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows\nupon AF request. The QoS modification to the QoS Flow associated with\nthe default QoS rule and other QoS Flows is done based on operator\npolicy and regulatory rules by means of local PCF configuration.  \nNOTE3: According to regional/national regulatory requirements and\noperator policy, On-Demand MPS (including MPS for Data Transport\nService) Service Users can be assigned the highest priority.  \nNOTE4: If no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service\napplies only to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.  \nNOTE5: MPS for DTS controls the priority of traffic on QoS Flows\nindependent of the application(s) being used. Other mechanisms (e.g.\nPriority PDU connectivity service) can be used to control the priority\nof traffic on other QoS Flows under the control of specific data\napplication(s), based on operator policy.  \nNOTE6: MPS for Data Transport Service can be applied to any DNN other\nthan the well-known DNN for IMS.  \nFor MPS for Data Transport Service, the AF may also create an SDF for\npriority signalling between the UE and the AF (see clause6.1.3.11 of\nTS23.503\\[45\\]).  \nPriority treatment is applicable to IMS based multimedia services and\nPriority PDU connectivity service including MPS for Data Transport\nService.  \nPriority treatment for MPS includes priority message handling, including\npriority treatment during authentication, security, and Mobility\nManagement procedures.  \nPriority treatment for MPS session requires appropriate ARP and 5QI\n(plus 5G QoS characteristics) setting for QoS Flows according to the\noperator\\'s policy.  \nNOTE7: Use of QoS Flows for MPS with QoS characteristics signalled as\npart of QoS profile enables the flexible assignment of 5G QoS\ncharacteristics (e.g. Priority Level) for MPS.  \nWhen an MPS session is requested by a Service User, the following\nprinciples apply in the network:\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the fuzzy rules in the automatic network access decision-making?\nOptions:\noption 1: To calculate the QoS improvement for network handover\noption 2: To determine the best network application for vehicular users\noption 3: To determine the priority of network access based on traffic conditions\noption 4: To establish the relationship between premise variables and achievable QoS\noption 5: To calculate the data flow rates for voice and video services\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: To establish the relationship between premise variables and achievable QoS\n"

The QoS values in the tables\nrepresent end to end performance, including mobile to mobile calls and\nsatellite components. Delay values represent one -way delay (i.e. from\noriginating entity to terminating entity). [ ]{.underline} The values\nincluded in the following tables are commonly accepted values from an\nend-user viewpoint \\[12\\]. The delay contribution within the mobile\nnetwork should be kept to minimum since there may be additional delay\ncontributions from external networks.  \nFigure 2 below summarises the major groups of application in terms of\nQoS requirements. Applications and new applications may be applicable to\none more groups. However, there is no strict one-to-one mapping between\nthe groups of application/service defined in this TS and the traffic\nclasses as defined in TS 23.107 \\[14\\]. For instance, an Interactive\napplication/service can very well use a bearer of the Conversational\ntraffic class if the application/service or the user has tight\nrequirements on delay.  \nFigure 2: Summary of applications in terms of QoS requirements  \nThe following tables further elaborate end user / application QoS\nrequirements.  \nTable 1: End-user Performance Expectations - Conversational / Real-time\nServices  \n+--------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\n| Medium | Appl    | Degree  | Data    | Key     |         |         |\n|        | ication | of      | rate    | perf    |         |         |\n|        |         | s       |         | ormance |         |         |\n|        |         | ymmetry |         | par     |         |         |\n\nInformation 5:\nf\\) NRCellCU.  \ng\\) Valid for packet switched traffic.  \nh\\) 5GS.  \ni\\) This measurement is to support the Retainability KPI \\\"QoS flow\nRetainability\\\" defined in TS 28.554 \\[8\\].  \n##### 5.1.1.13.2.2 In-session activity time for UE {#in-session-activity-time-for-ue.H6}  \na\\) This measurement provides the aggregated active session time for UEs\nin a cell.  \nb\\) CC.  \nc\\) Number of session seconds aggregated for UEs in a cell.\\\nFor QoS flows with bursty flow, a UE is said to be \\\"in session\\\" if\nthere is user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any\nQoS flow data on a Data Radio Bearer (UL or DL) has been transferred\nduring the last 100 ms.\\\nFor QoS flows with continuous flow, the QoS flows (and the UE) is seen\nas being \\\"in session\\\" in the context of this measurement as long as\nthe UE is in RRC connected state, and the session time is increased from\nthe first data transmission on the QoS flow until 100 ms after the last\ndata transmission on the QoS flow.  \nA particular QoS flow is defined to be of type continuous flow if the\n5QI is any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.  \nd\\) Each measurement is an integer value.  \ne\\) The measurement name has the form QF.SessionTimeUE  \nf\\) NRCellCU.  \ng\\) Valid for packet switched traffic.  \nh\\) 5GS.  \ni\\) This measurement is to support the Retainability KPI \\\"QoS flow\nRetainability\\\" defined in TS 28.554 \\[8\\].  \n##### 5.1.1.13.3 QoS flow setup  \n###### 5.1.1.13.3.1 Number of QoS flow attempted to setup  \na\\) This measurement provides the number of QoS flows attempted to\nsetup.

(For TDD systems, the phases will be fully correlated.)  \nc\\) Shadowing among different mobiles is uncorrelated. In practice, this\nassumption would not hold if mobiles are very close to each other, but\nwe make this assumption just to simplify the model.  \nd\\) The spatial channel model should allow any type of antenna\nconfiguration (e.g. whose size is smaller than the shadowing coherence\ndistance) to be selected, although details of a given configuration must\nbe shared to allow others to reproduce the model and verify the results.\nIt is intended that the spatial channel model be capable of operating on\nany given antenna array configuration. In order to compare algorithms,\nreference antenna configurations based on uniform linear array\nconfigurations with 0.5, 4, and 10 wavelength inter-element spacing will\nbe used.  \ne\\) The composite AS, DS, and SF shadow fading, which may be correlated\nparameters depending on the channel scenario, are applied to all the\nsectors or antennas of a given base. Sub-path phases are random between\nsectors. The AS is composed of 6 x 20 sub-paths, and each has a precise\nangle of departure which corresponds to an antenna gain from each BS\nantenna. The effect of the antennas gain may cause some change to the\nchannel model in both AS and DS between different base antennas, but\nthis is separate from the channel model. The SF is a bulk parameter and\nis common among all the BS antennas or sectors.  \nf\\) The elevation spread is not modeled.  \ng\\) To allow comparisons of different antenna scenarios, the transmit\npower of a single antenna case shall be the same as the total transmit\npower of a multiple antenna case.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 9.1.1 Simulation setup  \nWe model a macro-cell environment, where the site deployment consists of\na uniform hexagonal pattern containing 19 base station sites, each\nserving 3 cells. The site-to-site distance is 3000 m. We use a 2-D\nsectorization antenna model which has antenna gains as shown in Fig.1.\nAntenna tilting is not considered in our simulations. The transmit power\nof the base station is 20 watt per carrier per cell. The path loss model\nis 128.1+37.6\\*log(*r*) in dB, where *r* is the distance in km from the\nmobile to the base station. The shadowing loss is log-normal with a\nstandard deviation of 8 dB. The receiver is assumed to operate at 9 dB\nnoise figure. To simplify our analysis, we assume that all the radio\nlinks have the same power delay profile. All the mobiles in the system\nare moving at 3 km/h. Two multipath models are considered, a heavily\ndispersive model and a mildly dispersive model. The heavily dispersive\nmodel consists of four chip-spaced rays with exponential power delay\nprofile. The average relative powers for the four paths are 0, -3, -6\nand -9 dB, respectively. This power delay profile is identical to the\npower delay profile of the Case3 channel specified in \\[67\\]. Hence, we\nwill refer to this channel as simply the Case3 channel. The mildly\ndispersive model has three chip-spaced paths with average relative power\nof 0, -12.5, and -24.7 dB. This channel model resembles the Pedestrian A\nchannel model in \\[67\\].  \n![](media/image20.png){width=\"4.36875in\" height=\"3.4027777777777777in\"}  \nFigure 9.1: 2-D sectorization antenna pattern used in our simulations  \nFor link adaptation, we use a MCS table based on link simulation results\nof an ideal receiver in AWGN. The MCS table is shown in Table 1. The\nSINR in Table 1 is for every HS-PDSCH symbol (16 chips) per code. The\nSINR range is determined to achieve less than 10% block error rate for\nthe 1^st^ transmission. In system-level simulations however, we include\n\nInformation 3:\n\\- Determine the pathloss and shadowing of all sectors. (Note that\n\\\"pathloss\\\" implicitly includes antenna patterns as well.)  \n\\- Rank the sectors in order of received power (based on pathloss and\nshadowing). The base with the strongest received power is the serving\nbase, and the others are interfering bases.  \n\\- Model the strongest *B* interfering sectors as spatially correlated\nprocesses whose covariances are determined by their channel matrices.\nThese channel matrices are generated from Clauses 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 and\naccount for the pathloss, shadowing, and fast fading variations. The way\nin which the channel realizations are employed depends on the receiver\nalgorithm and simulation methodology. For example, if only the\nstatistics of the interfering sectors are required, their signals can be\nmodeled as spatially correlated additive Gaussian noise processes with\ncovariances determined by the channel matrices.  \n\\- Model the remaining sectors as spatially white Gaussian noise\nprocesses whose variances are based on a flat Rayleigh fading process.\nHence the variances are varying over the duration of a simulation drop.  \nTo model the remaining \\\"weak\\\" sectors, we assume that the mean power\nof the flat Rayleigh fading process is equal to the effects of pathloss\nand shadowing from each sector. Therefore if the received power from the\n*b-*th sector due to pathloss and shadowing is, then the Rayleigh\nfading process for the *m-*th receive antenna (*m* = 1,..., *M*) as a\nfunction of time is given by where the mean of over time is. The fading\nprocesses for each sector and receive antenna are independent, and the\ndoppler rate is determined by the speed of the mobile. We assume that\nthe fading is equivalent for each mobile receive antenna. The total\nreceived noise power per receive antenna due to all \\\"weak\\\" sectors at\nthe *m-*th antenna is  \n(5.7-1)  \nwhere *F* is the set of indices for the \\\"weak\\\" sectors.\n\nInformation 4:\nchannels.  \nA.2 Model descriptions\n----------------------  \nThe main difference between the COST 259 model and previous models is\nthat it tries to describe the complex range of conditions found in the\nreal world by distributions of channels rather than a few \"typical\"\ncases. The probability densities for the occurrence of different\nchannels are functions of mainly two parameters:  \n1\\) Environment  \n2\\) Distance  \nGiven a certain environment (e.g. Urban Macrocell) and a certain\ndistance (or distance range/cell radius), the parameters describing the\ndistribution functions for this particular case can be extracted.\nPerforming a sufficient number of channel realizations will give a\ndistribution of channels which give a much better representation of\nreality than what would be possible using only one channel.  \nThe environments identified so far in COST 259 are given in Table A.1,\nalthough these are by no means written in stone. The macrocellular\nenvironments have the same names as the GSM models. (It is being\ndiscussed if there should be a distinction between indoor and outdoor\nmobiles for the macrocellular environments.)  \nTable A.1: Preliminary environments identified by COST 259.  \n--------------- -------------------- ---------------------------\nMacrocell       Microcell            Picocell\nTypical Urban   (Street Canyons)     (Tunnel/Corridor)\nBad Urban       (Open Places)        (Factory)\nRural Area      (Tunnels)            (Office/Residential Home)\nHilly Terrain   (Street Crossings)   (Open Lounge)\n--------------- -------------------- ---------------------------  \nIn COST 259, a number of properties of the propagation channel has been\nconsidered in the model work. The full proposal will include all of\nthese properties, but it is quite simple and straightforward to\nimplement the model in a modular structure, so that each of the\nproperties (listed in Table A.2) can be switched on or off individually\n\nInformation 5:\nRadiowave Propagation (Digest No. 1994/231), IEE Colloquium on\nMicrocellular measurements and their prediction, 1994 pp. 2/1-2/6.  \n\\[2\\] L.

The specification describes a multiplexing service\nthat may be accessed with a network protocol to contact any one of a\nnumber of available TCP services of a host on a single, well-known port\nnumber.  \nThe specification of TCPMUX, IETFRFC1078\\[10\\], was deprecated in\n2016 by IETFRFC7805\\[12\\] mainly because there were very limited\ndeployments, all of them none in an Internet context. However, as it is\na solution that would be used in a private (3GPP) networks, it is a\nsolution that can be considered when developing new TCP-based protocols.\n\nInformation 2:\nprovide resilience against packet loss. A BSS/MGW sending a Multiplexing\npacket indicating support of multiplexing shall be ready to receive\nmultiplexed packets at the announced UDP port. A single UDP port for\nmultiplexing shall be used per destination IP address.  \nA BSS/MGW receiving an RTCP packet, where the peer indicated its\nreadiness to receive multiplexed data streams, may apply multiplexing to\nsend the corresponding RTP data streams towards the sender of the RTCP\npacket. If the BSS/MGW decides to apply multiplexing, it can immediately\nstart sending multiplexed data streams towards the corresponding UDP\nmultiplexing port announced in the received RTCP Multiplexing packet.\nThe BSS/MGW shall indicate in subsequent RTCP Multiplexing packets if it\napplies multiplexing with or without header compression for the given\nuser connection  \nA BSS/MGW that does not receive RTCP or receives RTCP without the RTCP\nMultiplexing packet shall continue to send data for the user connection\nwithout applying multiplexing.  \nA BSS/MGW that does not support multiplexing will ignore the unknown\nreceived RTCP Multiplexing packet according to RTCP procedures and will\ncontinue to send data for the user connection without applying\nmultiplexing.  \nSending of a RTCP Multiplexing packet indicating readiness to receive\nmultiplexed data streams does not necessarily mean that the BSS/MGW is\nready to send multiplexed data streams, i.e. multiplexing may be applied\non a single or on both directions for a given RTP session.  \n#### 5.5.3.3 RTCP Multiplexing packet  \nThe format of the RTCP Multiplexing packet is specified in figure\n5.5.3.3.1.  \n------------------- ----------------------- ----------- --------------- ------------------- ---------------------------- --- --- -- --\nBits                Number of Octets\n7                   6                       5           4               3                   2                            1   0\n\nInformation 3:\nmultiplexer layer provides multiplexing of data arranged in octet\nstreams with no other framing; if the structure of the data has to be\nconveyed, a convergence layer may be necessary. The present document\ndefines some convergence layers, others may be added later.  \nFigure 1: Protocol Stacks  \nThe multiplexer provides a virtual connection between a process in the\nTE and a similar process in the UE. For example, a PC application\nsupporting SMS functions could be connected to the SMS handler in the UE\nvia a multiplexer channel.  \nThe present document uses start-stop transmission with eight-bit\ncharacters. Communication between the two multiplexing entities takes\nplace using frames constructed as defined below.  \nEach channel between TE and UE is called a Data Link Connection (DLC)\nand is established separately and sequentially.  \nEach DLC may have individual flow control procedures for buffer\nmanagement purposes and the aggregate link also has overall flow control\nmechanisms.  \nDLCs have two modes of operation; Error-Recovery Mode (ERM) and\nnon-error-recovery mode (non-ERM), the choice of mode is made when a DLC\nis established. DLCs using error recovery mode may exist on the same\nlink as DLCs using non-error recovery mode. If the error-recovery mode\n(ERM) is to be used at least on one DLC, then the multiplexer must be\nconfigured with the ISO HDLC transparency mechanism. The use of error\nrecovery mode is optional. Non-error recovery mode uses the UI frame or\nUIH frame to carry user data; error recovery mode uses the I frame.  \nThe multiplexer has three operating options, basic, advanced without\nerror recovery and advanced with error recovery. The characteristics of\nthe options are:  \nBasic:  \n\\- length indicator used instead of the HDLC transparency mechanism;  \n\\- different flag octet from that used by HDLC;  \n\\- can not be used on links which use XON/XOFF flow control;  \n\\- may have longer recovery procedure from loss of synchronisation.\n\nInformation 4:\n\\- Source ID, 15 bits.  \nFor identification of the different connections. The value shall be the\nsource UDP port of the corresponding non-multiplexed RTP/codec PDU\npacket divided by two (only even numbered ports are used for RTP\nsessions).  \nThe multiplexed RTP PDU shall be inserted in the IP/UDP packet directly\nafter the corresponding Multiplex Header. The multiplexed RTP packet PDU\nshall follow the rules defined in IETF RFC 1889 \\[9\\] and consists of\nthe full RTP header and the RTP payload. If the multiplexed RTP packet\nPDU does not end at a byte boundary, then the remaining bits of its last\nbyte shall be padded with zeros.  \nThe multiplexing method does not limit the number of packets being\nmultiplexed and it is thus the data link layer protocol that defines the\nmaximum frame size. In order to avoid additional delay in the network\nthe packets should not be delayed more than 1 ms to 2 ms, which also\neffectively limits the number of multiplexed packets and makes the\nmultiplexing-jitter low.  \nFigure 2: Example of multiplexed packet with two RTP frames  \n6 Packet switched domain\n========================  \n6.1 Transport network user plane\n--------------------------------  \nDefined in Ref TS 25.414 \\[4\\] subclause 6.1.3.  \nNote: The Transport Network Layer as described in ref TS 25.414 \\[4\\]\nsubclause 6.1.3, may be directly between HNB and the CN.  \n######## Annex A (informative): Change history  \n------------ -------------- -------- --------- ------------------------------------------------------------- ---------\n**TSG\\#**   **TSG Doc.**   **CR**   **Rev**   **Subject/Comment**                                           **New**\nInitial Skeleton                                              0.1.0\nAddition of TP for signalling for bandwidth efficiency        0.2.0\nPresented for approval at RAN\\#46                             2.0.0\n46           RP-091104                         Approved at RAN\\#46                                           9.0.0\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.3.4 RTCP  \nRTCP is a control protocol included in the RTP specification.

        "question": "What is the meaning of Interworking WLAN (I-WLAN)?",
        "answer": "option 4: A WLAN that interworks with a 3GPP system.",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### H.2.2.2 ICS Interworking Function  \nThe ICS interworking function is introduced in order to support inbound\nand outbound roamers in networks that do not support IMS or ICS.\nDetailed in clauseH.5.2.2.  \nH.2.3 Reference points\n----------------------\n\nInformation 2:\nthe benefits of extending the business case. The I-WLAN Service Provider\nmay e.g. become a \"Hot-spot provider for mass events\", moving its\nequipment to the corresponding site. The 3GPP operator can efficiently\naddress such a market.  \nThe dynamic establishment of 3GPP-WLAN interworking may however also\nsave costs in the case of stationary WLANs (in airports etc): The I-WLAN\nService Provider can install the WLAN on-the-fly, e.g. by buying and\ninserting an extended UICC from the 3GPP operator which contains the\nComposition Agreement, and by connecting the Access Router e.g. to a DSL\nline; no additional configuration is necessary.  \nThe 3GPP operator on the other hand can save costs by selling \"nomadic\nI-WLAN access packets\" off-the-shelve to I-WLAN Service Providers. The\ncontracts associated with this packet may be configured uniformly, i.e.\nthey are not individually negotiated with each I-WLAN Service Provider.\nI-WLAN Service Providers could buy these packets (e.g. including the\nextended UICC with the CA) very much like users today buy USIM (UMTS\nSubscriber Identity Module) and SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards.  \nAs a result the Network Composition procedure ultimately provides a\ncapability to \"plug and play\" the WLAN into the 3GPP network, thus\nenabling the WLAN to become -- as I-WLAN -- an additional radio access.  \n#### 5.3.1.3 Pre-Conditions  \nBoth 3GPP network and nomadic I-WLAN are CCNs. The I-WLAN has a\npre-shared secret with the 3GPP operator, e.g. the I-WLAN Service\nProvider bought a special UICC, i.e. a UICC with a special contract\n(including a CA), that allows a CCN featuring the UICC to act as a\nI-WLAN. The CA contains the IP Address of the appropriate 3GPP gateway,\ne.g. a Packet Data Gateway (PDG). A storage in the 3GPP network, e.g.\nthe HLR/HSS has stored the CA together with other contract-specific\ninformation (e.g. International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) etc).  \n#### 5.3.1.4 Normal Flow\n\nInformation 3:\n### 10.6.2 Interworking with WLAN  \nThe next generation access network shall support interworking with WLAN.\nThe number of solutions selected should be minimized.\n\nInformation 4:\nand System Aspects, Telecommunication management; as identified below:  \nTS 28.680: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network\n(WLAN) management; Concepts and requirements  \nTS 28.681: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network\n(WLAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);\nRequirements  \n**TS 28.682: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network\n(WLAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);\nInformation Service (IS)**  \nTS 28.683: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network\n(WLAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);\nSolution Set (SS) definitions  \n1 Scope\n=======  \nThe present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP)\nnamed Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) Management Network Resource\nModel (NRM) IRP, through which an IRPAgent can communicate management\ninformation to one or several IRPManagers concerning WLAN management.\nThe WLAN management NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications defining\nRequirements, a protocol neutral Information Service and one or more\nSolution Set(s).  \nThe present document specifies the protocol neutral WLAN management NRM\nIRP: Information Service (IS).  \nThe present document also contains stage 2 descriptions for those\nfunctionalities for the **WLAN Management.**  \n2 References\n============  \nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in\nthis text, constitute provisions of the present document.  \n\\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\nedition number, version number, etc.) or non\u2011specific.  \n\\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.  \n\\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case\nof a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a\nnon-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that\ndocument *in the same Release as the present document*.\n\nInformation 5:\nnetworks (e.g. they do not allow sophisticated charging models).\nHowever, the need to provide 3GPP inter-working with these technologies\n/ networks has been shown already for 3GPP Rel-6 with the work item for\n3GPP - WLAN inter-working.  \n**Deductions**  \n\\- An AIPN shall be able to provide means to ease inter-working with a\nmultitude of broadband wireless IP-based networks.  \n#### 4.2.3.3 Progress in ad-hoc networking for user defined services.  \nAd-hoc Networks denote particular kinds of networks that may establish\nthemselves automatically - \\\"ad-hoc\\\" - (i.e. without explicit\nadministration) between mobile terminals. From today\\'s perspective,\ngenerally all the activity concerning development in the field of Ad-hoc\nNetworks (radio spectra, terminal communication and mechanisms to create\nAd-hoc Networks) is happening outside 3GPP. However, AIPN operators may\nbenefit from letting Ad-hoc Networks interact with the AIPN, thereby\ncreating traffic in the AIPN; e.g. there could be Ad-hoc Network access\nto public networks via AIPN by at least one of the Ad-hoc Network\nmembers serving as a kind of wireless connectivity gateway.  \nExamples for such Ad-hoc Networks could be Personal Networks, as\ndescribed later in the present document, or CB-type radio communications\namongst listeners to a pop concert. In the case of Personal Networks an\nAIPN may provide connectivity to a server in an AIPN operator's network,\nin the pop concert example an AIPN may provide the capability for remote\nlisteners to join.  \nTechnically, an Ad-hoc Network is defined as a self-organizing and\nself-managing network of autonomous mobile terminals *without any\ninfrastructure support*. In fact, it is this property which essentially\ncharacterizes Ad-hoc Networks, and as a consequence, no centralized\nradio resource management for ad-hoc networking necessarily exist.  \nImportant aspects of Ad-hoc Networks which may impact an AIPN are:  \n\\- Identification, addressing and routing: If an Ad-hoc Network\n\nQuestion: What is the meaning of Interworking WLAN (I-WLAN)?\nOptions:\noption 1: A service that allows multimedia conversational communications between two or more users.\noption 2: A service that provides access to IP Multimedia Services.\noption 3: A service that provides real-time bidirectional conversational transfer of media.\noption 4: A WLAN that interworks with a 3GPP system.\noption 5: All of the above.\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: A WLAN that interworks with a 3GPP system.\n"

The visual features from the current\nframe are matched with the spatial features and keyframe information\nstored in the spatial map to estimate the pose of the camera when it\ncaptured the frame.\n\nInformation 4:\nheight=\"0.23333333333333334in\"}of the peak region, centered at bin\n![](media/image1811.wmf){width=\"0.12291666666666666in\"\nheight=\"0.16458333333333333in\"} is defined as:  \n![](media/image1812.wmf){width=\"3.7465277777777777in\"\nheight=\"0.27847222222222223in\"} (1215)  \nEach shape vector is quantized with 9 bits; 8 bits for the VQ index and\n1 bit for classification.

The statistics have been measured within the time\nperiod of one month. The provided VoD service offers a wide variety of\nmovies of more than 5000 files among which the users can make their\nselection from. In these statistics an average of about 3400 requests\nper day is reported. Further statistics on the data are given in Figure\nC.1, Figure C.2, Figure C.3, and Table C.1.  \nFigure C.1 shows the number of requests issued by all users for all\nfiles grouped per hour. A clear diurnal and weekly pattern can be\nobserved.

That brings many challenges to network\ndeployment and evolution. Different user data access interfaces impose\ncomplexity on network topology as well as on application development,\nespecially for booming Internet services and incoming IP-based UE\napplications; separated user data increases management workload.\nMoreover, new networks and services such as IMS are expected, so that\nthe introduction of their user data only makes things worse, not to\nmention network and service convergence even if those user data have a\nlot in common and are correlated to each other. Separation also\nundermines the value of user data mining.  \nUser data convergence is required to ensure the consistency of storage\nand data models. User data convergence will simplify overall network\ntopology and interfaces, overcome the data capacity bottleneck of a\nsingle entry point, avoid data duplication and inconsistency and reduce\nCAPEX and OPEX. Also it will simplify the creation of new services and\nfacilitate service development and deployment though a common set of\nuser data. Finally it will promote service and network convergence to\nsupport the increasing number of new services including Internet\nservices and UE applications. In this regard, a new facility User Data\nRepository (UDR) should be considered for user data convergence.  \n![](media/image4.png){width=\"3.8777777777777778in\"\nheight=\"3.095833333333333in\"}  \nFigure 2 User Data Convergence  \nAs illustrated by Fig. 2, User Data Convergence, as opposed to User Data\nSilo, is simply to move the user data from where it belonged, to a\nfacility here called User Data Repository (UDR) where it can be\naccessed, stored and managed in a common way. Despite of the diversity\nof user data structures for different services, user data can be\ndecomposed and reformed by a common data model framework (e.g. tree-like\n\nInformation 3:\nfixed direction.

In this way, the UE location information\nrequired by NWDAF will be finer granular, such as around 5m near the\nbillboard. At first, NWDAF conducts preliminary screening on the speed\nand heading information with ignoring users who move at a fast speed.\nThen, NWDAF determines the duration of the users and counts the number\nof people passing by and valid viewers in this certain area.  \nIn order to solve the aforementioned issue, this solution proposes a\nscheme for providing statistics/prediction service under the measuring\noutdoors advertisements viewers scenario.\n\nInformation 4:\nRest of the Time/Days   Any        Streaming Service   AR/VR-Game          VPN\nDefault Profile                                    Any                     Any        Streaming Service   AR/VR-Game          VPN  \n\\- Krishna does not have his preference pre-set, however it is\nestablished by the 5G System based on his usage pattern in below order:  \nKrishna's Application Preference Setting derived by 5G System\n--------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- ------------------- ------------------- --------------\nTime of Day                                                     Location   Preference-1        Preference-2        Preference-3\n9-5 Work Days                                                   Office     VPN                 Streaming Service   AR/VR-Game\nRest of the Time/Days                                           Any        Streaming Service   VPN                 AR/VR-Game\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.54.1 Description  \nAs described in the TS23.288\\[5\\], currently the preferred granularity\nof location information is either on TA level or cell level, however,\nbelow use case demands more precious location information.  \n\\- **Measuring the number of viewers who see outdoor advertisements**:\nIn order to measure the users who see the advertisement in a specific\nlocation, statistical information of a specific location is required to\nestimate the viewers of an advertisement.  \n\\- **Inference of taste and recommendation based on visited places**: It\nis important to consider the location information before sending the\nrecommendation.

High directivity antenna\narray also has side lobes which are often undesirable since they may\ncause intra-cell or inter-cell interference. Side lobe levels can be\nreduced via tailoring the amplitude across the antenna array which is\noften referred as amplitude weighting technology. Whilst amplitude\nweighting/tapering reduces the side lobes it also makes the main lobe\nwider and hence reduces gain. It needs tradeoff between antenna gain and\nside lobe suppression. For example:  \n![](media/image21.emf){width=\"3.029861111111111in\"\nheight=\"2.26875in\"}![](media/image22.emf){width=\"2.9923611111111112in\"\nheight=\"2.238888888888889in\"}  \nFigure 9.2.2-1: Examples for amplitude weighting/tapering: left: Kaiser\n(a=3), right: Chebwin (R=35dB)  \nApplying tapering electrically for the complete array will results in a\nmain beam peak EIRP drop due to the amplitude window itself. In\naddition, the directivity will also reduce as an effect of a wider beam,\nas seen in Figure 9.2.2-1.  \nIf tapering is applied at sub-array level the power can be redistributed\nbetween elements in the sub-array, hence no power loss due to tapering\nwill be introduced.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 9.2.4 Beam restrictions  \nDepending on base station implementation and intended deployment\nscenario different types of beamforming schemes can be considered. For\nAAS base stations operating within FR1 (410 to 7125 MHz) typically\ncodebook or reciprocity-based beamforming will be used for transmitted\ndown link beams, while for AAS base stations operating within FR2 (24250\nto 52600 MHz) typically grid of beams beamforming concepts will be used\nfor transmitted downlink beams. By restricting the angular range for\nwhich the beams can be transmitted, interference power in unintended\ndirections can be limited. For codebook-based beamforming codes in the\ncodebook associated to large beam steering angles can be disabled and\nprohibited from being used for transmission. The same principle can be\nadopted for grid of beams systems. For reciprocity-based beam forming,\nmodification to the applied excitations needs to be carried out to avoid\nsteering directions associated to generation of unintended interference\nin the side lobe region.  \nBy limiting the vertical beam steering range within a certain interval,\nit is possible to control the level of the grating lobe to a level\nsimilar to other sidelobes. Not using specific beams with large down\ntilts angles does not affect the network performance since, other beams\ncan be used by proving sufficient power using sidelobes close to the\nbase station. The vertical range in which the side lobe level is\nguaranteed will depend on the array antenna geometry used by a specific\nbase station. As an example (4x8 array, with 3x1 sub-array), in Figure\n9.2.4-1 the results of beam restrictions are visualised. In the left\nfigure all beams are plotted, while in the right figure beams causing\ninterference towards the sky have been disabled.  \n![Histogram Description automatically\ngenerated](media/image24.png){width=\"6.268055555555556in\"\nheight=\"2.723611111111111in\"}  \n**Figure 9.2.4-1:** Controlling interference using beam restrictions\n\nInformation 3:\n|                     | projected UE load    |                      |\n|                     | with respect to      |                      |\n|                     | virtual resource and |                      |\n|                     | radio resource on    |                      |\n|                     | the target cell.     |                      |\n+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+  \n#### 7.2.5.3 Inter-gNB beam selection optimization  \n##### 7.2.5.3.1 Description  \nThis MDA capability is for inter-gNB beam selection optimization.  \n##### 7.2.5.3.2 Use case  \nWith the deployment of 5G networks, Massive MIMO has been used on a\nlarge scale.

If new QoS parameters are needed\nwhether the existing Policy framework in TS23.503\\[5\\] needs to be\nenhanced to account for the new QoS parameters and how.  \n\\- Whether the current QoS model for 5GS defined in clause5.7 of\nTS23.501\\[3\\] needs to be enhanced to account for the following types\nof application AI/ML traffic:  \ni\\) data collected for training and inference and shared by the\napplication server or UE over the 5GS; and  \nii\\) AI/ML models trained by the application server or UE shared over\nthe 5GS.  \n\\- Whether the current QoS Monitoring can be used to expose, to an\nauthorized 3rd party, monitoring and status information, regarding\nresource utilization of network services associated to this 3rd party\nAI/ML application, as specified in clause6.40 of TS22.261\\[2\\].

If not, what enhancements are needed.  \n5.7 Key Issue \\#7: 5GS Assistance to Federated Learning Operation\n\nInformation 4:\nAI/ML inference functions (i.e. those instantiated within the gNB) with\neffects across multiple managed objects such as interference management\nwhich may impact multiple cells. Such AI/ML inference functions may not\nbe able to have a wider view of the network state. As such, a\ncentralized controller (i.e. a controller that with a wider and common\nview to the set of managed objects) is needed to control and coordinate\nboth centralized and distributed AI/ML inference functions.\nSpecifically, the controller may (based on received network data and\nanalytics insight):  \n\\- diagnose network problem(s) to identify the nature of the problem;\nand  \n\\- receive the capabilities of the available AI/ML inference functions\neither directly from the AI/ML inference functions or from a Capability\nLibrary that acts as a registry to which the capability of each NAF is\nadded each time a new NAF introduced into the system; and  \n\\- evaluate the capabilities of the AI/ML inference functions to\nidentify the best (set and sequence of) AI/ML inference functions to\naddress the identified problem(s); and  \n\\- trigger the ML entities to act, providing at trigger time any\nrequired extra generalized or specific information.  \n##### 5.2.2.2.5 Orchestrating decisions of AI/ML inference functions or ML entities  \nGiven the multiple ML entities which may differ in terms of source\nvendors and behavioural characteristics, the operator may not find it\nappropriate to grant access to the network to all the different ML\nentities (both for security and operability reasons).  \nIn that case, there is a need for an orchestration functionality that\ntakes responsibility for the end-to-end performance of the Autonomous\nNetwork and that supervises the ML entities to guarantee the end-to-end\nperformance.

There are many radio feature parameters of RAN NE level or\ncell level, for examples, MLB related parameters, resource schedule\nrelated parameters, cell reselection related parameters, handover\nrelated parameters, different radio feature parameters affect each other\nand the combination number of various parameter values is large.\nTherefore, it is complex to adjust radio feature configuration\nparameters to achieve the optimized RAN UE throughput. So introducing\nthe autonomous network level for RAN UE throughput optimization will be\nbenefit for operator to achieve the full autonomy goal step by step and\nhave clear view on which typical issues can be addressed by utilizing\nautonomy mechanism in corresponding steps.

In contrast to\nthe conventional shallow-structured NN architectures, DNNs, also\nreferred to as deep learning, made amazing breakthroughs since 2010s in\nmany essential application areas because they can achieve human-level\naccuracy or even exceed human accuracy. Deep learning techniques use\nsupervised and/or unsupervised strategies to automatically learn\nhierarchical representations in deep architectures for classification\n\\[26\\]. With a large number of hidden layers, the superior performance\nof DNNs comes from its ability to extract high-level features from raw\nsensory data after using statistical learning over a large amount of\ndata to obtain an effective representation of an input space \\[25\\]. In\nrecent years, thanks to the big data obtained from the real world, the\nrapidly increased computation capacity and continuously-evolved\nalgorithms, DNNs have become the most popular ML models for many AI\napplications.  \nA.3 Training and inference\n--------------------------  \n***Training*** is a process in which a AI/ML model learns to perform its\ngiven tasks, more specifically, by optimizing the value of the weights\nin the DNN.

Categorization of AI/ML approaches (figure adopted from\n\\[25\\])  \nWithin AI is a large subfield called ***machine learning (ML)***, which\nwas defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the field of study that gives\ncomputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\nInstead of the laborious and hit-or-miss approach of creating a\ndistinct, custom program to solve each individual problem in a domain, a\nsingle ML algorithm simply needs to learn, via a process called\ntraining, to handle each new problem \\[25\\]. Many ML methodologies as\nexemplified by decision tree, K-means clustering, and Bayesian network\nhave been developed to train the model to make classifications and\npredictions, based on the data obtained from the real world \\[19\\].  \nA.2 Deep neural network\n-----------------------  \nWithin the ML field, there is an area that is often referred to as\nbrain-inspired computation, which is a program aiming to emulate some\naspects of how we understand the brain to operate. Since it is believed\nthat the main computational elements a human brain are 86 billion\nneurons, the two subareas of brain-inspired computation are both\ninspired by the architecture of a neuron \\[25\\], as shown in figure\nA.2-1 (a).  \nCompared to spiking computing approaches, e.g. \\[3\\], the more popular\nML approaches are using ***\"neural network\"*** as the model. Neural\nnetworks (NN) take their inspiration from the notion that a neuron's\ncomputation involves a weighted sum of the input values. But instead of\nsimply outputting the weighted sum, a NN applies a nonlinear function to\ngenerate an output only if the inputs cross some threshold, as shown in\nfigure A.2-1(a). Figure A.2-1(b) shows a diagrammatic picture of a\ncomputational neural network. The neurons in the input layer receive\n\nInformation 3:\n***convolution neural network (CNN)*** \\[25\\].

Applying\nvarious convolutional filters, CNN models can capture the high-level\nrepresentation of the input data, making it popular for image\nclassification \\[7\\] and speech recognition \\[42\\] tasks. In recent\nyears, the modern CNN models have dramatically improved the performance\nof image classification tasks (e.g., AlexNet \\[7\\], VGG network \\[8\\],\nGoogleNet \\[9\\], ResNet \\[18\\], MobileNet \\[19\\]), as shown in figure\nA.4-3 \\[25\\].  \n![](media/image36.jpeg){width=\"3.8715277777777777in\"\nheight=\"1.6888888888888889in\"}  \nFigure A.4-2.

The input of RNN consists of the\ncurrent input and the previous samples. Each neuron in an RNN owns an\ninternal memory that keeps the information of the computation from the\nprevious samples. As shown in figure A.4-4, the basic unit of RNN is\ncalled cell, and further, each cell consists of layers and a series of\ncells enables the sequential processing of RNN models.

Figure\nA.4-1 presents three popular structures of DNNs: multilayer perceptrons\n(MLPs), convolution neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs). ***Multilayer perceptrons (MLP)*** model is the most\nbasic DNN, which is composed of a series of fully connected layers\n\\[41\\]. In a fully connected layer, all outputs are connected to all\ninputs, as shown in Figure A.4-1. Hence MLP requires a significant\namount of storage and computation.  \n![](media/image35.jpeg){width=\"3.576388888888889in\"\nheight=\"1.3347222222222221in\"}  \nFigure A.4-1.

Due to the distributed\nnature of their blocks and the complexity of their internal make up, it\nis sometimes difficult to distinguish between Distributed multi-element\nstructures and a sub-network.  \nA.1.10 Management logical layered architecture within the management physical view\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nSeveral specializations of the OS physical block can be defined to\nsupport a physical realization of function blocks in logical layers (see\nFigures 9.1).  \nThe variety of types of management functionality is reflected in a\ncorresponding flexibility for the mapping of OSFs to Operations Systems\nso that, in principle, any combination of specialized OSFs can map to an\nOperations System. As a result, the interfaces offered by an Operations\nSystem may include functionality from various OSF specializations (e.g.,\nservice management, service resource management and transport resource\nmanagement functions).  \nSuch a flexible transition from the functional view to a physical view\n(subject to constraints from the information architecture as outlined in\nclause 14) allows for different types of OS interactions and\ncorresponding Operations Systems Interface design patterns:  \n> -- Provider/consumer;\n>\n> -- Peer-to-peer.  \nAs a result, a physical architecture may flatten the functional\nManagement Layers described in 11.6 into a single, unified management\nlayer for the co-management of several functional Management Layers.\nExamples of this layer co-management paradigm are shown in Figures 9.2-1\nand 9.2-2.  \nThe unified management layer is opaque, i.e., the interworking of the\nfunctional Management Layers is invisible to the user of the Interface.  \nA.1.11 Interface concept\n\nInformation 3:\n### 28.2.2 OA&M Access to the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN  \nEach Participating Operator can have their own OA&M capabilities, which\nare used for monitoring and for selected operations in a shared\nE-UTRAN/NG-RAN.

The TSN\ntechnology is used to support real-time control and synchronization of\nhigh-performance machines over a single, standard Ethernet network,\nsupporting multi-vendor interoperability and integration. In order to\nenable seamless interoperability with existing wired networks, the 5G\nnetwork needs to be end-to-end integrated into the industrial network\ncontrol and management process using TSN.  \nThe higher communication layers (HCL) can be provided by communication\nin automation technologies (e.g., OPC UA, PROFINET, etc.).  \n######## Annex C: Analysis of relationship between OPC UA and FF architecture  \nC.1 Overview\n============  \nOPC 10000-1 \\[20\\] presents the concepts and overview of OPC UA.

Multiple MC service clients can be supported by the MC MBS\nuser agent. The conceptual MC MBS user agent presents data and\ninformation received from the UE\\'s lower layers to each MC service\nclient according to the most recently established communication context.\nThe functionalities of the MC service client and of the MC MBS user\nagent are described in clauses4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of 3GPPTS23.479\\[20\\].\nThe information flows and procedures described in 3GPPTS23.479\\[20\\]\napply, with the following clarifications:  \n\\- References to 4G \\\"eMBMS\\\" are understood to be references to 5G\n\\\"MBS\\\";  \n\\- Unless used as in \\\"multicast IP address\\\", the stand-alone term\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the MBMSAPI_MCS in the MBMS APIs for Mission Critical Services?

        "question": "Which frequency bands are commonly used for mmWave channels?",
        "answer": "option 1: 30-300 GHz",
        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n5G by utilizing untapped frequency bands above 24 GHz. This abundant\nspectrum can deliver the fastest available speeds, extreme capacity and\nlow latency.  \n3GPP has done several studies on the channel model for frequency\nspectrum above 6GHz, e.g. in TR38.900\\[61\\]. According to\\[59\\],\nextreme higher propagation loss and penetration loss in mmWave spectrum\nis expected, and the frequency is sensitive to blockage, e.g. by foliage\nor the human body. However, again according to \\[59\\], performance tests\nfor mmWAVE provide extraordinary KPIs:  \n\\- 14.7/3 Gbps cell peak throughout (DL/UL) in an 800 MHz spectrum band.  \n\\- One-way user plane latency between 1--1.5ms.  \n\\- Farthest access distance: 2.6km in line-of-sight with a few small\ntrees.  \nAccording to\\[62\\], commercial 5G modems support mmWAVE as well as dual\nconnectivity, and upload speeds of 2.2Gbps can be achieved by the\naggregated Frequency Ranges FR2 400MHz (on n261) and FR1 100MHz (n77).\nAccording to\\[61\\], mmWave bands can accommodate more capacity and\nbandwidth than any other band. And since spectrum in these bands is\nabundant, mmWave spectrum is ideally placed to deliver high speeds, low\nlatency and high capacity, all at the same time. The short wavelength of\nmmWave allows for very small antennas, which helps with beam forming for\nenhanced coverage and spectral efficiency. Promoted by the whole\nindustry, 5G mmWAVE commercialization grows rapidly. GSA's report \\[58\\]\nindicates that, up to May2021, twenty-eight operators in sixteen\ncountries/territories are known to be already deploying 5G networks\nusing mmWave spectrum at 24GHz.  \nBased on this analysis, mmWAVE is an attractive technology for\nproduction scenarios that typically rely on fully wired data rates. In\nparticular, interactive video live production scenarios, i.e. video\nproduction with almost real time interaction between video director and\ncameras, require extreme low latency, as they allow camera direction in\n\nInformation 2:\n100 MHz                                                                                                                                                                                  746668, 753332, 768000, 791000\nNOTE: 10 MHz channel bandwidth shall only apply in certain regions where the absence of non 3GPP technologies can be guaranteed on a long-term basis in this version of specification.  \nTable 5.4.2.3-3: Allowed N~REF~ (NR-ARFCN) for operation in Band n96  \n+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+\n| Channel Bandwidth | Allowed N~REF~                                  |\n+===================+=================================================+\n| 20 MHz            | **797000, 798332, 799668, 801000, 802332,       |\n|                   | 803668, 805000, 806332, 807668, 809000, 810332, |\n|                   | 811668, 813000, 814332,**                       |\n|                   |                                                 |\n|                   | **815668, 817000, 818332, 819668, 821000,       |\n|                   | 822332, 823668, 825000, 826332, 827668, 829000, |\n|                   | 830332, 831668, 833000, 834332, 835668, 837000, |\n|                   | 838332, 839668, 841000, 842332, 843668, 845000, |\n|                   | 846332, 847668, 849000, 850332, 851668, 853000, |\n|                   | 854332, 855668, 857000, 858332, 859668, 861000, |\n|                   | 862332, 863668, 865000, 866332, 867668, 869000, |\n|                   | 870332, 871668, 873000, 874332**                |\n+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+\n| 40 MHz            | **797668, 800332, 803000, 805668, 808332,       |\n|                   | 811000, 813668, 816332, 819000, 821668, 824332, |\n|                   | 827000, 829668, 832332, 835000, 837668, 840332, |\n|                   | 843000, 845668, 848332, 851000, 853668, 856332, |\n|                   | 859000, 861668, 864332, 867000, 869668,**       |\n\nInformation 3:\n|   |               |               |               | reception of  |\n|   |               |               |               | MBMS (i.e.,   |\n|   |               |               |               | MCCH and      |\n|   |               |               |               | MTCH).

(For TDD systems, the phases will be fully correlated.)  \nc\\) Shadowing among different mobiles is uncorrelated. In practice, this\nassumption would not hold if mobiles are very close to each other, but\nwe make this assumption just to simplify the model.  \nd\\) The spatial channel model should allow any type of antenna\nconfiguration (e.g. whose size is smaller than the shadowing coherence\ndistance) to be selected, although details of a given configuration must\nbe shared to allow others to reproduce the model and verify the results.\nIt is intended that the spatial channel model be capable of operating on\nany given antenna array configuration. In order to compare algorithms,\nreference antenna configurations based on uniform linear array\nconfigurations with 0.5, 4, and 10 wavelength inter-element spacing will\nbe used.  \ne\\) The composite AS, DS, and SF shadow fading, which may be correlated\nparameters depending on the channel scenario, are applied to all the\nsectors or antennas of a given base. Sub-path phases are random between\nsectors. The AS is composed of 6 x 20 sub-paths, and each has a precise\nangle of departure which corresponds to an antenna gain from each BS\nantenna. The effect of the antennas gain may cause some change to the\nchannel model in both AS and DS between different base antennas, but\nthis is separate from the channel model. The SF is a bulk parameter and\nis common among all the BS antennas or sectors.  \nf\\) The elevation spread is not modeled.  \ng\\) To allow comparisons of different antenna scenarios, the transmit\npower of a single antenna case shall be the same as the total transmit\npower of a multiple antenna case.\n\nInformation 3:\nUE distribution (horizontal)    Uniform\nMinimum BS - UE distance (2D)   0 m\nChannel model                   Indoor Office\nShadowing correlation           NA  \n![](media/image5.jpeg){width=\"6.127083333333333in\"\nheight=\"2.970138888888889in\"}  \nFigure 4.2.1.3-1: Network layout for indoor  \nTable 4.2.1.3-2: Multi operators layout for indoor  \nParameters              Values                                  Remark\n----------------------- --------------------------------------- --------\nMulti operator layout   Coordinated operation (0% Grid Shift)\n\nInformation 4:\n| shadow fading, |                |                |                |\n| and *K* =      |                |                |                |\n| Ricean         |                |                |                |\n| K-factor.      |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| NOTE 2: The    |                |                |                |\n| sign of the    |                |                |                |\n| shadow fading  |                |                |                |\n| is defined so  |                |                |                |\n| that positive  |                |                |                |\n| SF means more  |                |                |                |\n| received power |                |                |                |\n| at UT than     |                |                |                |\n| predicted by   |                |                |                |\n| the path loss  |                |                |                |\n| model.         |                |                |                |\n|                |                |                |                |\n| NOTE 3: The    |                |                |                |\n| following      |                |                |                |\n| notation for   |                |                |                |\n| mean           |                |                |                |\n| (*\u03bc*~lgX~=m    |                |                |                |\n| ean{log~10~(X) |                |                |                |\n| }) and         |                |                |                |\n| standard       |                |                |                |\n| deviation      |                |                |                |\n| (*\u03c3*~lgX~=     |                |                |                |\n| std{log~10~(X) |                |                |                |\n\nInformation 5:\n### 7.4.4 Autocorrelation of shadow fading  \nThe long-term (log-normal) fading in the logarithmic scale around the\nmean path loss *PL* (dB) is characterized by a Gaussian distribution\nwith zero mean and standard deviation. Due to the slow fading process\nversus distance \u2206*x*\\\n(\u2206*x* is in the horizontal plane), adjacent fading values are\ncorrelated.

In a spatial\nconsistency procedure in Clause 7.6.3, the cluster specific random\nvariables are also correlated following the exponential function with\nrespect to correlation distances in the two dimensional horizontal\nplane.  \n7.5 Fast fading model\n---------------------  \nThe radio channel realizations are created using the parameters listed\nin Table 7.5-1. The channel realizations are obtained by a step-wise\nprocedure illustrated in Figure 7.5-1 and described below. It has to be\nnoted that the geometric description covers arrival angles from the last\nbounce scatterers and respectively departure angles to the first\nscatterers interacted from the transmitting side. The propagation\nbetween the first and the last interaction is not defined. Thus, this\napproach can model also multiple interactions with the scattering media.\nThis indicates also that e.g., the delay of a multipath component cannot\nbe determined by the geometry. In the following steps, downlink is\nassumed. For uplink, arrival and departure parameters have to be\nswapped.  \nNote: the channel generation in this clause is enough for at least the\nfollowing cases.  \n\\- Case 1: For low complexity evaluations  \n\\- Case 2: To compare with earlier simulation results,\n\nQuestion: What type of distribution does the shadowing term in the in vivo channel follow?\nOptions:\noption 1: Poisson distribution\noption 2: Uniform distribution\noption 3: Normal distribution\noption 4: Exponential distribution\noption 5: Log-normal distribution\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 5: Log-normal distribution\n"

The Shared RAN could cover\nlarge geographical areas, as in the case of national or regional network\nsharing. The Shared RAN coverage could also be heterogeneous, i.e.\nlimited to few or many smaller areas, for example in the case of Shared\nin-building RANs. A shared RAN should be able to efficiently\ninteroperate with a non-shared RAN. Each Core Operator may have their\nown non-shared RAN serving areas adjacent to the Shared RAN.

Different protocol\nsplit options between Central Unit and lower layers of gNB nodes may be\npossible. The functional split between the Central Unit and lower layers\nof gNB nodes may depend on the transport layer. High performance\ntransport between the Central Unit and lower layers of gNB nodes, e.g.\noptical networks, can enable advanced CoMP schemes and scheduling\noptimization, which could be useful in high capacity scenarios, or\nscenarios where cross cell coordination is beneficial. Low performance\ntransport between the Central Unit and lower layers of gNB nodes can\nenable the higher protocol layers of the NR radio stacks to be supported\nin the Central Unit, since the higher protocol layers have lower\nperformance requirements on the transport layer in terms of bandwidth,\ndelay, synchronization and jitter.  \n\\- Co-sited deployment with E-UTRA: In this scenario the NR\nfunctionality is co-sited with E-UTRA functionality either as part of\nthe same base station or as multiple base stations at the same site.\nCo-sited deployment can be applicable in all NR deployment scenarios\ne.g. Urban Macro. In this scenario it is desirable to fully utilise all\nspectrum resources assigned to both RATs by means of load balancing or\nconnectivity via multiple RATs (e.g. utilising lower frequencies as\ncoverage layer for users on cell edge).\n\nInformation 5:\n\\[RP-151551\\].

The BSS to MS delay is indeed the major\ncontributor to the delay, at least in the current network\nimplementations.  \nTo give an idea about the delay values some measurement data is\npresented below. The measurements were taken using a Nokia 6230 TEMS\nconnected to a PC in a lab environment with a single EDGE capable TRX\nand a 4\\*64 kbps dynamic ABIS pool. 855 PING (32 Bytes) requests were\ncaptured. There was no other traffic in the network.  \nThe results show that the CN delay (RTT\\_Gb\\_Gb: observed on Gb uplink\nto seen on Gb downlink) is about 1.5 % of the total PING delay to the\nDNS server. The downlink BSC delay is larger than UL due to TBF\nallocations.  \nThe RTT\\_MS\\_MS (total round trip) varied between 540 ms to 1 200 ms,\nwhereas the RTT\\_Abis\\_Abis (Abis up to Abis down) varied from about 70\nms to 190 ms. Hence the BSS to MS is the major contributor to the\nend-2-end delay.  \nThe measurements indicated that the RLC\\_RTT constitutes the main part\nof the delay. It is likely that the PC-MS PPP link delay and the MS\nprocessing delay is significant, but that could not be measured.  \n##### 10.1.1.4.6 The importance of the PING size  \nThe average end-2-end RTT is important for TCP, but the smaller PING\nsizes do not show the impact of the RLC RTT for TCP. A 64 byte PING will\nbe contained in a single PDU, whereas a 1 500 Byte PING is segmented\ninto many PDUs where the probability that at least one of them is\nretransmitted is substantially higher.  \nTo show this effect we consider PING sizes of 64 and 1 500 Bytes,\nrespectively. In the simulations, the end-2-end RTT is measured 50 times\nand the time between the pings are set to 2.002 sec. By the 2 ms extra\nwait between the PINGs, the time that the IP packets arrive to the\nbuffer for first transmission over the radio is phase shifted compared\nto the TTI clock. Hence, in average each packet will wait \u00bd TTI before\nnext TTI is sent.  \nFigure 296 shows the average end-2-end delay as a function of the RLC\n\nInformation 2:\nC.1.2.11.2-5.  \nTable C.1.2.11.2-1: Rel.16 NR positioning latency for DL method (Case 1)\n\\[15\\]  \n+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| Source/Destination:  |                      |                      |\n| NW/UE                |                      |                      |\n|                      |                      |                      |\n| Positioning          |                      |                      |\n| technique DL-TDOA    |                      |                      |\n| and DL-AOD, mode:    |                      |                      |\n| UE-A                 |                      |                      |\n|                      |                      |                      |\n| Initial and Final    |                      |                      |\n| RRC States:          |                      |                      |\n| CONNECTED            |                      |                      |\n+======================+======================+======================+\n| Latency Component    | Value Range          | Description of       |\n|                      |                      | Latency Component    |\n+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| Request Location     | 0.14 ms \\~ 1 ms      | 38.214 section       |\n| Information message  |                      | 5.1.2.               |\n| (gNB UE)             |                      |                      |\n+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| Request Location     | For UE capability-1: | 38.214 section 5.3.  |\n| Information message  |                      |                      |\n| Reception (PHY       | 0.57 ms \\~ 0.78 ms   |                      |\n| Processing time for  |                      |                      |\n| PDSCH, UE)           | For UE capability-2: |                      |\n|                      |                      |                      |\n\nInformation 3:\n### 8.1.3 Higher layer latency analysis for Rel-16  \n#### 8.1.3.1 Latency analysis for DL-TDOA/DL-AoD  \nReferred to \\[27\\], Figure 8.1.3.1-1 shows the messaging between the\nLMF, the AMF, the gNBs and the UE to perform DL-TDOA and DL-AoD\nprocedure.  \nFigure 8.1.3.1-1: DL-TDOA/DL-AoD positioning procedure  \nThe latency performance analysis for UE assisted DL-TDOA and DL-AoD are\nprovided in table 8.1.3.1-1.  \nTable 8.1.3.1-1: Latency performance analysis for UE assisted DL-TDOA\nand DL-AoD  \n+-----------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+\n| Step                  | Delay Value \\[ms\\] | Description of        |\n|                       |                    | Latency Component     |\n+=======================+====================+=======================+\n| Step 1 LPP Request    | > 18-34.5          | Processing delays: 14 |\n| capabilities          |                    | ms                    |\n|                       |                    |                       |\n|                       |                    | \\- UE:                |\n|                       |                    | T~UEProc-RRCDLInfo~   |\n|                       |                    |                       |\n|                       |                    | \\- gNB:               |\n|                       |                    | T~gNBProc-NAS/LPP~    |\n|                       |                    |                       |\n|                       |                    | \\- AMF: T~AMFProc~    |\n|                       |                    |                       |\n|                       |                    | \\- LMF: T~LMFProc~    |\n|                       |                    |                       |\n|                       |                    | Signalling            |\n|                       |                    | delay:4-20.5ms        |\n|                       |                    |                       |\n|                       |                    | \\- UE-gNB: T~UE-gNB~  |\n\nInformation 4:\n| delay due to waiting |                      |                      |\n| for DL subframe for  |                      |                      |\n| receiving UL grant   |                      |                      |\n| is 0 **for the given |                      |                      |\n| starting subframes   |                      |                      |\n| under the            |                      |                      |\n| corresponding TDD    |                      |                      |\n| configuration**.     |                      |                      |\n|                      |                      |                      |\n| **7.

There are several criteria to classify the types of\nMachine Learning depending on the characteristics of the method used.\nThis use case is intended to describe a case of multi-agent multi-device\nML operations with heavy data (i.e., the data size is huge) when there\nis partial or total disturbance for data collection/transfer (e.g.,\nprivacy regulation or temporary technical limitation like shortage of\nnetwork resources or temporary failure). As depicted in Fig. 7.3.1-1,\nthis use case, Part I, is specifically related to a scenario that there\nare multiple agents and multiple collecting devices where the devices\ncan perform ML operations, not necessarily in full but as much as they\ncan (i.e., functional splitting is possible between a device and one or\nmore learning agents).  \nNOTE 1: MBL (Multiple Batch Learning) is one of examples that belong to\nthis scenario, which is known to be better performing when the data is\ntoo big for a single agent/server to handle.  \nNOTE 2: A learning agent is a type of AI/ML training servers that can be\ninside 5GS (e.g., AI/ML-based support for communication) or outside 5GS\n(e.g., communication support for AI/ML). Multi-agent training has\nmultiple collaborating agents involved as depicted in Fig. 7.3.1-1 where\ndotted lines denote collaboration relation between two or more learning\nagents. The respective learning agents may have different operational\nsituations (e.g., different technical issues, such as congestion or\nbreakdown, and different jurisdiction-related restrictions). In this use\ncase, it is assumed that the learning agent is typically in the cloud,\ninteracting with UE (as a collecting agent).

Categorization of AI/ML approaches (figure adopted from\n\\[25\\])  \nWithin AI is a large subfield called ***machine learning (ML)***, which\nwas defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the field of study that gives\ncomputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\nInstead of the laborious and hit-or-miss approach of creating a\ndistinct, custom program to solve each individual problem in a domain, a\nsingle ML algorithm simply needs to learn, via a process called\ntraining, to handle each new problem \\[25\\]. Many ML methodologies as\nexemplified by decision tree, K-means clustering, and Bayesian network\nhave been developed to train the model to make classifications and\npredictions, based on the data obtained from the real world \\[19\\].  \nA.2 Deep neural network\n-----------------------  \nWithin the ML field, there is an area that is often referred to as\nbrain-inspired computation, which is a program aiming to emulate some\naspects of how we understand the brain to operate. Since it is believed\nthat the main computational elements a human brain are 86 billion\nneurons, the two subareas of brain-inspired computation are both\ninspired by the architecture of a neuron \\[25\\], as shown in figure\nA.2-1 (a).  \nCompared to spiking computing approaches, e.g. \\[3\\], the more popular\nML approaches are using ***\"neural network\"*** as the model. Neural\nnetworks (NN) take their inspiration from the notion that a neuron's\ncomputation involves a weighted sum of the input values. But instead of\nsimply outputting the weighted sum, a NN applies a nonlinear function to\ngenerate an output only if the inputs cross some threshold, as shown in\nfigure A.2-1(a). Figure A.2-1(b) shows a diagrammatic picture of a\ncomputational neural network. The neurons in the input layer receive\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.5.1 Description  \nThis use-case is illustrative for a specific example but is readily\nextensible for more advanced scenarios involving disaster scenarios,\nrescue operations or even autonomous vehicle operations. The focus of\nthis scenario is on machine-to-machine AI/ML transfer learning and\ninference systems that are networked together using 5G networks to\nprovide smart automotive applications and services.  \nThe scenario assumes that there exist multiple AI/ML systems available,\nin a high-reliability, low-latency, high-bandwidth system optimized for\nmachine-to-machine interaction. The proposed AI/ML systems may\ncontinuously exchange and share AI-ML model layers in a distributed and\nor federated network as determined by the system in response to a change\nof events, conditions or emergency situations, to improve some or all of\nthe ML system prediction accuracy.

In some scenarios (e.g., hotspot indoor/outdoor places,\netc.), single or a few small cell node(s) are sparsely deployed, e.g. to\ncover the hotspot(s). Meanwhile, in some scenarios (e.g., dense urban,\nlarge shopping mall, etc.), a lot of small cell nodes are densely\ndeployed to support huge traffic over a relatively wide area covered by\nthe small cell nodes. The coverage of the small cell layer is generally\ndiscontinuous between different hotspot areas. Each hotspot area can be\ncovered by a group of small cells, i.e. a small cell cluster.  \nFurthermore, smooth future extension/scalability (e.g.: from sparse to\ndense, from small-area dense to large-area dense, or from normal-dense\nto super-dense) should be considered. For mobility/ connectivity\nperformance, both sparse and dense deployments should be considered with\nequal priority.\n\nInformation 2:\nincreased on the DL is due to the BCCH layer transmitting constantly on\nall resources. Using power savings on the BCCH layer up to 6 dB helps,\nbut the overall interference situation still reflects a rather highly\nloaded system. On the UL, the requirement on constant transmission does\nnot exist, but for 23 dBm devices, more would have to use repetitions to\nreach the network, which increases resources usage. Still, it should be\nnoted that the out of coverage level is not different for 33 dBm devices\nand 23 dBm devices, implying that 23 dBm devices can cope with the\nnetwork deployment, even if resource usage is significantly increased\ncompared to the 33 dBm device deployment.  \nIn table ZF.6.2-5 and table ZF.6.2-6 the same figures are shown\nexpressed as percent of total resources available on one TS EC-CCCH (in\ntotal up to 36 bursts out of the 51 in the multiframe can be used for\nEC-AGCH).  \nFor example, for a resources usage of 2.3 bursts, and with an arrival\nrate of 6.8 users/s, the total number of bursts used for EC-AGCH per\nsecond is on average 15.64, and hence the percent of EC-CCCH resources\nused is 15.64/(13/3.060\\*36) = 10.2%.  \nTable ZF.6.2-5: % of total resource for EC-CCCH occupied, 33 dBm  \n-------- ----------------- ---------------------\nBCCH\\    Resource usage\\   Resource usage\\\nRe-use   DL \\[\\#bursts\\]   UL \\[\\#bursts\\][^2]  \n12       10.2%             3.5%  \n9        10.2%             3.5%  \n3        14.7%             4.1%\n-------- ----------------- ---------------------  \nTable ZF.6.2-6: % of total resource for EC-CCCH occupied, 23 dBm  \n-------- ----------------- -----------------\nBCCH\\    Resource usage\\   Resource usage\\\nRe-use   DL \\[\\#bursts\\]   UL \\[\\#bursts\\]  \n12       10.2%             5.3%  \n9        10.2%             5.6%  \n3        14.7%             8.2%\n-------- ----------------- -----------------  \nIt can be seen that there is somewhat higher load on the DL EC-CCCH\nresources than on the UL. Also, EC-PCH load will add to the overall\n\nInformation 3:\nholes.  \n\\- In case that adjacent channel interference is encountered within a WA\ncell, reduction of the allocated peak data rate (or AMR codec rate) can\nprovide the UE with additional power to combat interference. Hence,\nthere is possibility for trading off peak data rates for reducing\npossible DL coverage holes.  \n\\- For areas where the received Node B DL signals (or representatively\nthe CPICH RSCP's) from the own and adjacent interfering system differ by\nmuch more than 40 dB, own system signal strength may be increased by RNP\nmethods. This can be done by means of directing / tilting antennas beams\ntowards the building in question (e.g. in case of interfering LA\nnetwork) or by building additional sites.  \nB.2 Intra-frequency interference\n================================  \nB.2.1 General\n-------------  \nThe RF specification for Base Stations is to a large extent based on\nstatistical averaging of interference effects and on specific MCL\nrequirement. This should normally be sufficient to eliminate significant\ninterference.  \nIn the case of Local Area and Medium Range BS, also considering some of\ntheir likely deployment environments (indoor, street canyons) there is\nhowever a high probability that the current UE and BS specifications\nlead to localised significant intra-frequency interference and then to\nlocalised coverage and capacity holes.  \nThis informative Annex highlights through an example the impacts of UE\nperformance requirements on the range of coupling loss that can be\noperated without degraded the network performance.  \nB.2.2 Example analysis for localized interference\n-------------------------------------------------  \nIn this paragraph, the impact of the MCL requirement on UE and BS\n(either LA or MR) sensitivity is analysed.\n\nInformation 4:\ndownload and image or video clip upload) typically gain from increased\nmean bit rates, but also gain from reduced latency, e.g. throughput is\nlimited by the TCP window size divided by the round trip time.  \n\\- Conversational services (like Voice over IP (VoIP) and enhanced Push\nto talk over Cellular (PoC)), as well as, e.g. on-line gaming services\ntypically have high requirements on latency and fast access.  \n\\- All services may gain from improved coverage, e.g. video-telephony is\na service that will need (better) coverage for higher bit rates for both\nuplink and downlink.  \n\\- All services may gain from a mobile station always being connected to\nthe most appropriate base station, i.e. as seen from a radio performance\nperspective, as this may yield higher capacity, reduce latency etc. due\nto improved interference conditions.  \n\\- Particular requirements may be set by services like broadcast TV over\nMBMS bearers. Typically, high bit rates are required at the same time as\nrobustness is important to fulfil coverage and latency requirements as\nwell as providing interactivity.  \nA GSM/EDGE network may interoperate with WCDMA RAT, either within an\noperator\\'s network or with different operators. There are also\nstandalone GSM/EDGE networks. Both the GSM/WCDMA networks and the GSM\nonly networks will benefit from the increased GSM/EDGE service\nportfolio. A combined WCDMA & GSM/EDGE network will benefit from better\nservice continuity between the accesses resulting in an easier resource\nutilisation and service provisioning. GSM/EDGE only networks can give\ntheir users an increased range of end user services/applications and\npossibly make use of applications/services that do not require\nadaptations to access specific capabilities. This could potentially lead\nto reduce cost of provisioning and create a wider use of services.  \nAs a general guideline, the following subclauses detail the performance\nrequirements and design constraints the proposed features/candidates\n\nInformation 5:\nCDF of the user throughput), given a reasonable system complexity.\nActual quantitative requirements can be determined in succeeding study\nitems on physical and higher layer enhancements.  \nConsistent user experience over the coverage area is highly desirable.\nSmall cell enhancement should keep the fairness of the user throughput\nfor both downlink and uplink in a scenario, where user distribution is\ndynamically changing.  \nSmall cell enhancement should target the capacity per unit area (e.g.\nbps/km^2^) to be as high as possible, for a given user and small cell\ndistribution, typical traffic types and considering a reasonable system\ncomplexity.  \nThe small cell enhancements should evaluate the impact of the actual\nbackhaul delays and provide solutions with the aim of improved system\nperformance. Other aspects, for example service quality of VoLTE (e.g.\nMOS score) and delay/jitter impacts on services (video streaming, video\ncalls,.etc.), could also be addressed in follow-on studies.  \n**8.2 Mobility performance**\n----------------------------  \nSmall cell enhancement should support mobility which is required for the\ndeployment scenarios described in clause 6.1.  \nSmall cell enhancement should support mobility which is required for the\nfuture spectrum use in higher frequency bands (e.g. more available\nspectrum and wider bandwidth).  \nSmall cell enhancement should support mobility for flexible coverage\nconditions described in clause 8.3.  \nFor UEs being served on a macro layer and for the targeted mobile speeds\nup to 30 km/h, small cell nodes need to be discovered, and potential\nmobility to small cell node performed, in a timely manner and with low\nUE power consumption in a situation when the UE moves into the coverage\narea of the small cell layer.  \nMobility across densely deployed small cell nodes, and between macro and\nsmall cell on the same frequency layer, should be targeted with good\nperformance for mobile speeds up to 30 km/h.\n\nQuestion: What is the advantage of network densification in ultra dense networks (UDNs)?\nOptions:\noption 1: Reduced system capacity\noption 2: Increased interference\noption 3: Decreased signal power from serving ANs\noption 4: Improved propagation conditions\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: Improved propagation conditions\n"

An MTSI client may support multiple streams, even of\nthe same media type, without being an MSMTSI client. Such an MTSI client\nmay, for example, add a second video to an ongoing video telephony\nsession as shown in TS 26.114 Annex A.11.  \n**MSMTSI MRF:** An MSMTSI client implemented by functionality included\nin the MRFC and the MRFP.  \n**MSMTSI client in terminal:** An MSMTSI client that is implemented in a\nterminal or UE. The term \\\"MSMTSI client in terminal\\\" is used in the\npresent document when entities such as MRFP, MRFC or media gateways are\nexcluded.  \n**MTSI client:** A function in a terminal or in a network entity (e.g. a\nMRFP) that supports MTSI.  \n**MTSI client in terminal:** An MTSI client that is implemented in a\nterminal or UE. The term \\\"MTSI client in terminal\\\" is used in the\npresent document when entities such as MRFP, MRFC or media gateways are\nexcluded.  \n**MTSI media gateway (or MTSI MGW):** A media gateway that provides\ninterworking between an MTSI client and a non MTSI client, e.g. a CS UE.\nThe term MTSI media gateway is used in a broad sense, as it is outside\nthe scope of the current specification to make the distinction whether\ncertain functionality should be implemented in the MGW or in the MGCF.  \n**Operational mode:** Used for the EVS codec to distinguish between EVS\nPrimary mode and EVS AMR-WB IO mode.  \n**Simulcast:** Simultaneously sending different encoded representations\n(simulcast formats) of a single media source (e.g. originating from a\nsingle microphone or camera) in different simulcast streams.  \n**Simulcast format:** The encoded format used by a single simulcast\nstream, typically represented by an SDP format and all SDP attributes\nthat apply to that particular SDP format, indicated in RTP by the RTP\nheader payload type field.  \n**Simulcast stream:** The RTP stream carrying a single simulcast format\nin a simulcast.  \n3.2 Abbreviations\n\nInformation 4:\nto indicate the codec mode that should be used after switching to EVS\nAMR-WB IO mode.

The probability densities for the occurrence of different\nchannels are functions of mainly two parameters:  \n1\\) Environment  \n2\\) Distance  \nGiven a certain environment (e.g. Urban Macrocell) and a certain\ndistance (or distance range/cell radius), the parameters describing the\ndistribution functions for this particular case can be extracted.\nPerforming a sufficient number of channel realizations will give a\ndistribution of channels which give a much better representation of\nreality than what would be possible using only one channel.  \nThe environments identified so far in COST 259 are given in Table A.1,\nalthough these are by no means written in stone.

Path powers follow the\nexponential channel shapes in the COST 259 model. The delay spreads for\neach model are close to expected medians when applying the COST 259\nmodel in reasonably sized macrocells. In the rural model a direct path\nis present, resulting in Rice-type fading when filtered to wideband\nchannels. The hilly terrain model consists of two clusters, a typical\nsituation in these environments.  \nWith the chosen parameters the models will be quite similar to the GSM\nchannel models \\[2\\], after filtering to the GSM bandwidth.  \nIn Section 5, the channel models are specified explicitly. The tap\ndelays have been determined by generating 20 independent identically\ndistributed values from a uniform distribution in the interval, where\n*\u03c3\u03c4* is the rms delay spread. For the Hilly Terrain channel 10 paths\nhave been generated for each cluster and for the Rural Area model there\nis a total of 10 taps. Relative powers have then been calculated using\nthe channel shapes in Annex A, Table A.3. The channels have been\nnormalised so that the total power in each channel is equal to one.  \n5 Channel model descriptions\n============================  \nRadio wave propagation in the mobile environment can be described by\nmultiple paths which arise due to reflection and scattering in the\nmobile environment. Approximating these paths as a finite number of N\ndistinct paths, the impulse response for the radio channel may be\nwritten as:  \n![](media/image2.wmf){width=\"1.19375in\" height=\"0.4722222222222222in\"}  \nwhich is the well known tapped-delay line model.

Figure 5.10 illustrates the dynamic range of each\nchannel realization, plotted as a complementary cdf. The difference\nbetween the 1.25 MHz and 5 MHz channel bandwidths are shown in the\nresolvable dynamic range curves. (Powers are combined within a chip time\nas a simple way to estimate the resolvable powers.) The 1% highest value\nis approximately the same for both bandwidths. The dynamic range D is\ncalculated from D = 10\\*log10(max pwr / min pwr) for each channel\nrealization.  \nFigure 5.10: Dynamic range of path powers per channel realization,\n(NLOS)  \nFigure 5.11: Composite BS angle spread  \nThe composite angle spread at the base is described in Figure 5.11 for\nthe various K-factors that are seen in the micro-cell model, along with\nthe LOS/NLOS mix expected when the cell radius is 500m (as measured from\nthe cell center to cell corner). For the NLOS case, the average\ncomposite Base AS = 19 degrees. When experiencing LOS paths with\nincreased K-factors, the angle spreads are observed to decreased\naccordingly. The simulated average composite Base AS for the NLOS model\nis: 19.2 degrees, and the simulated average composite Base AS for the\nmixed propagation model is: 17.6 degrees.  \n![](media/image67.wmf){width=\"5.339583333333334in\"\nheight=\"3.995138888888889in\"}  \nFigure 5.12: Composite MS angle spread  \nThe composite UE angle spread is described in Figure 5.12 for increased\nK-factor from a LOS path, causes the composite AS to be decreased since\nmore power is present in a single direct component.

To help faster 5G rollout, the network operators can\ndeploy 5G using their existing LTE frequency bands and base stations\ndynamically share the resources based on the traffic load. As the time\nand frequency resources are shared between NR UE and LTE UE, the core\nrequirement for DSS is that existing essential channels of LTE, such as\nCRS (cell-specific reference signal), should be still transmitted for\nbackward compatibility. In DSS scenario (namely scenario 1), serving\ncell CRS rate matching is assumed to be configured for NR PDSCH, but the\nalways-on CRS signals from interference cells will interfere NR UE.  \nAnother scenario with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR is that LTE\nand NR are deployed in neighboring BSs/areas (namely scenario 2), when\nthe refarming progress is different in different areas. In scenario 2,\nthe CRS is not transmitted on the NR serving cell, and the CRS from\nneighboring LTE cell will cause interference to NR UE in the overlapping\nspectrum.  \nTo evaluate performance of different CRS interference handling schemes,\nthe two scenarios with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR are\nconsidered below in Figure 1.  \n\u2022 Scenario 1: Serving and interference cells are both operating in DSS\n(NR+LTE) mode  \n\u2022 Scenario 2: Serving cell is operating in NR mode and interference cell\nis operating in LTE mode  \nScenario 1:                                                                         Scenario 2:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n![](media/image9.png){width=\"3.2569444444444446in\" height=\"2.3680905511811026in\"}  ![](media/image10.png){width=\"3.259016841644794in\" height=\"2.326388888888889in\"}  \nFigure 5.1.1-1.

However, if only\n16-QAM is considered, there is fair chance that the HW impact is small\nor none. The impact on HW depends on the performance of present 8-PSK\nBSS. The increase of PAR may reduce the available maximum output power\nfor QAM-modulations by 2 dB compared to 8-PSK, assuming the power\ncapability of present BTSs is unchanged.  \nIf applied to UL as well, then the main impact is the increased\ncomplexity of the receiver as described above. If peak user data rate is\nincreased, the handling of higher peak data flow also needs to be\nconsidered.  \nThus introducing only 16-QAM on MCS-8 and MCS-9 will probably affect\nonly SW.\n\nInformation 3:\n14 ^(2*)*^      X                                      X\n15 ^(2*)*^                         X     X\n16 ^(2*)*^                         X           X\n17 ^(2*)*^                         X                   X\n18 ^(2*)*^                                     X       X\n19 ^(3*)*^      X                  X     X     X       X       X       X       X       X\n--------------- ------------------ ----- ----- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------  \nThe performance of the two lowest modes with sinusoidal tones (and also\nwith DTMF signals) is relatively low. The power of the one frequency\nwith dual frequency signals was in some cases decreased significantly.\nAlso some single sinusoidal signals were degraded when two lowest modes\nwere used. However, the two lowest modes are designed to be used only\nwith mode adaptation in poor radio channel conditions only for a very\nlimited time. For the higher modes, the outputs were acceptable.\nFrequencies from 6 300 Hz to 7 000 Hz became noise-like because of\nartificial high band generation.  \n21.5 Square wave signals\n------------------------  \nThree types of square wave signals with 50 % duty cycle were tested.  \n1\\) Square wave signal (test signals: 1..10);  \n2\\) Sum of two square wave signals (test signals: 11..18); and  \n3\\) Square wave signal bursts, where each burst were in different\nfrequency and separated by 0.5 s of all zero signal (test signal: 19).  \nThe length of the signals was about 8 s. The frequency contents of\ndifferent square test signals are given in table 21.3.  \nThe decoder output in this test was acceptable for the higher modes, but\nthe output was distorted for two lowest modes, like in the case of\nsinusoidal signals.  \nTable 21.3: Frequency contents of different square wave test signals  \n--------------- ------------------ ----- ----- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------\nTest signal /   Frequency \\[Hz\\]\n\nInformation 4:\nburst in the current TDMA frame.  \n\\- *\u03d5157* is a phase shift of either 0 or \u03c0h, and is constant during one\nburst.  \n\\- *\u03d50* is a random phase and is constant during all blind physical\nlayer transmissions of the same burst within the same TDMA frame.  \nFor EC-GSM-IoT, only integer timeslot lengths are allowed (see 3GPP TS\n45.010 \\[5\\]). If any blind physical layer transmission is transmitted\nin the uplink on timeslot 0 or timeslot 4, which are 157 symbols long,\nall following blind physical layer transmissions of the same burst in\nthat TDMA frame shall be shifted in phase by \u03c0h, i.e. *\u03d5157* = \u03c0h,\notherwise *\u03d5157* = 0. For the downlink this phase shift shall not be\napplied, i.e. *\u03d5157* = 0.  \n2.7 Overlaid CDMA\n-----------------  \nIn the case of Overlaid CDMA, the modulated RF carrier may be expressed\nwith an additional term compared to subclause 2.6 representing the\nOverlaid CDMA code:  \n$x(t') = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E_{c}}{T}}\\text{}\\text{.}\\text{}\\text{cos}(2\\pi f_{0}(t' + t_{0}) + \\phi(t') + \\phi_{\\text{157}} + \\phi_{0} + \\text{OC} \\cdot \\pi)$  \nwhere *OC* equals 0 or 1 in accordance with the applied Overlaid CDMA\ncode (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \\[3\\]) and is constant during one burst. For\neach blind physical layer transmission within a TDMA frame, *OC* equals\nits respective Overlaid CDMA code element. For example for Overlaid CDMA\ncode sequence \\'0011\\', *OC* equals 0 for the first two blind physical\nlayer transmissions and 1 for the last two blind physical layer\ntransmissions within a TDMA frame.  \nNOTE: If the blind physical layer transmissions within a TDMA frame are\ncontinuously modulated, a phase shift of \u03c0 for bursts with *OC*=1 can be\nwell approximated by inverting all the data values *di* (cf. subclause\n2.3), i.e. replacing their data values by 1-*di*, including three to\nfive guard bits preceding and following the tail bits, respectively.  \n3 Modulation format for 8PSK\n============================  \n3.1 Modulating symbol rate\n--------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\n### 5.4.4 Phase transition  \nWhen different bursts are transmitted from a BTS on a physical channel\nthe relative phase between these bursts are not specified and it cannot\nbe guaranteed that the phase is continuous. Besides the duration of\ntimeslots will not always be 156.25 symbols but can also be either 156\nor 157 symbols, which will be seen as a phase discontinuity by the\nmobile (see 45.010 clause 5.7).

However, during simultaneous reception and\ntransmission, the duplex filter causes considerable insertion loss in\nboth directions.  \nIn the downlink, the duplex filter insertion loss and the Tx noise in\nthe Rx band will lower the sensitivity. However, this desensitisation\ncan now be compensated by the new feature MSRD. The intention of the\nmultislot classes 13\\...18 was to allow for full-duplex operation. As\nlong as the radio requirements do not take inevitable hardware\nlimitations into account, the specified feature will never be\nimplemented. Hence the sensitivity requirements for Rx slots which\noverlap with Tx slots should be relaxed by e.g. 4 dB for type 2 MS\nsupporting MSRD. MSRD need not be supported simultaneously with downlink\ndual carrier, the more so as the downlink throughput also benefits from\nfull-duplex operation.  \nFor full-duplex operation, the relevant timeslot assignments will have\nat least 2 Tx slots. Hence a multislot power reduction by 3 dB would be\nallowed anyway if MULTISLOT\\_POWER\\_PROFILE 0 was chosen. This means\nthat a lower output power due to the duplex filter insertion loss will\nnot require a completely new relaxation. The objective should be that\nfull-duplex MS need only reduce their nominal maximum output power by 3\ndB, and this should be permitted. Even if the actual insertion loss of a\nduplex filter sample exceeds these 3 dB by 1\\...2 dB, the output power\nwill still fit into the tolerance range.  \nThe reduction may be limited to those Tx timeslots which overlap with Rx\nslots.  \nFor further analysis of full-duplex MS, see subclause 15.2.\n\nQuestion: How can the self interference in full-duplex communication be mitigated?\nOptions:\noption 1: Analog self interference cancellation\noption 2: Active digital interference cancellation\noption 3: Antenna cancellation\noption 4: All of the above\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: All of the above\n"

When multiple ML entities are employed, these ML\nentities may operate together in a coordinated way, such as in a\nsequence, or even a more complicated structure. In this case, any change\nin the performance of one ML entity may impact another, and consequently\nimpact the overall performance of the whole AI/ML inference function.\nTherefore, it is desirable that these coordinated ML entities can be\ntrained or re-trained jointly, so that the group of these ML entities\ncan complete a more complex task jointly with better performance.  \n#### 5.1.5.2 Use cases  \n##### 5.1.5.2.1 Support for ML entity modularity - joint training of ML entities  \nBesides the discovery of the capabilities of ML entities, services are\nneeded for identifying which AI/ML capabilities are used in specific use\ncase and how. 3GPP TS 28.105 \\[4\\] defines the inferenceType which\nindicates the type of inference, i.e. the use case that the ML model\nsupports. This indicator may be represented by the MDA type (see 3GPP TS\n28.104 \\[2\\]), Analytics ID(s) of NWDAF (see 3GPP TS 23.288 \\[3\\]),\ntypes of inference for RAN-intelligence, and vendor\\'s specific\nextensions.  \nIn order to address complex use cases, applying multiple, cooperative ML\nentities might be necessary. There are different ways in which the ML\nentities may cooperate.

Another example is the case where multiple\nML entities provide the output in parallel (either the same output type\nwhere outputs may be merged (e.g. using weights), or their outputs are\nneeded in parallel as input in the automation process or as input to\nanother ML entity.

Split AI/ML inference modes over endpoints  \n######### Annex C: General principle of AI/ML model/data distribution and sharing over 5G system  \nFor the inference tasks which requires low latency and desires the\nprivacy-sensitive data to be preserved at the UE side, offline AI/ML\ninference is desired, rather than the cloud-based inference. However, an\noffline AI/ML model running on mobile devices must have a relatively low\ncomputation complexity and a small storage size. An approach to enabling\noffline DNN models on mobile devices is to compress the model to reduce\nits resource and computational requirements \\[27-28, 35, 45\\]. However,\nDNN compression will lead to loss of inference accuracy and adaptivity\n\nInformation 4:\n> is performed locally at the mobile device. The advantage is that,\n> during the inference process, the device does not need to communicate\n> with the cloud/edge server. Another motivation of this mode is\n> preserving the privacy at the data source, i.e. the device, although\n> the privacy protection problem needs also be considered at the device\n> side. The disadvantage is potentially imposing an excessive\n> computation/memory/storage resource to the device. And also pointed\n> out by \\[10\\], we cannot assume the device always keep all the\n> potentially-needed AI/ML models onboard. In some cases, the mobile\n> device may need to obtain the AI/ML model from the edge cloud/server,\n> which requires a corresponding downloading data rate from the 5G\n> system, as introduced in Section 7.  \n-   Mode c): Device-cloud/edge split inference  \n> In this mode (as shown in Figure B.1-2 (c)), an AI/ML inference\n> operation or model is firstly split into two parts between the device\n> and the cloud/edge server according to the current system\n> environmental factors such as communications data rate, device\n> resource, and server workload. Then, the device will execute the AI/ML\n> inference up to a specific part or the DNN model up to a specific\n> layer, and send the intermediate data to the cloud/edge server. The\n> server will execute the remaining part/layers and sends the inference\n> results to the device. Compared to Mode a) and b), this mode is more\n> flexible and more robust to the varying computation resource and\n> communications condition. A key link for this mode is to properly\n> select the optimum split point between device side and network side\n> based on the conditions.  \n-   Mode d): Edge-cloud split inference  \n> This mode (as shown in Figure B.1-2 (d)) can be regarded as an\n> extension of Mode a). The difference is that the DNN model is executed\n> through edge-cloud synergy, rather than executed only on either cloud\n\nInformation 5:\n|                                                                      |\n| When there is a high requirement for QoE of enhanced video, the      |\n| terminal device cannot meet this requirement and cloud or edge       |\n| servers are needed for processing.

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\nNG-RAN:  \n**RAN awareness of slices**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports a differentiated handling of traffic for different\nnetwork slices which have been pre-configured. How NG-RAN supports the\nslice enabling in terms of NG-RAN functions (i.e. the set of network\nfunctions that comprise each slice) is implementation dependent.  \n**Selection of RAN part of the network slice**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports the selection of the RAN part of the network slice,\nby NSSAI provided by the UE or the 5GC which unambiguously identifies\none or more of the pre-configured network slices in the PLMN.  \n**Resource management between slices**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports policy enforcement between slices as per service\nlevel agreements. It should be possible for a single NG-RAN node to\nsupport multiple slices. The NG-RAN should be free to apply the best RRM\npolicy for the SLA in place to each supported slice.  \n**Support of QoS**  \n\\- NG-RAN supports QoS differentiation within a slice, and per\nSlice-Maximum Bit Rate may be enforced per UE, if feasible. How NG-RAN\nenables UE-Slice-MBR enforcement and rate limitation (see TS 23.501\n\\[3\\]) is up to network implementation.  \n**RAN selection of CN entity**  \n\\- For initial attach, the UE may provide NSSAI to support the selection\nof an AMF. If available, NG-RAN uses this information for routing the\ninitial NAS to an AMF. If the NG-RAN is unable to select an AMF using\nthis information or the UE does not provide any such information the\nNG-RAN sends the NAS signalling to one of the default AMFs.  \n\\- For subsequent accesses, the UE provides a Temp ID, which is assigned\nto the UE by the 5GC, to enable the NG-RAN to route the NAS message to\nthe appropriate AMF as long as the Temp ID is valid (NG-RAN is aware of\nand can reach the AMF which is associated with the Temp ID). Otherwise,\nthe methods for initial attach applies.  \n**Resource isolation between slices**  \n\\- The NG-RAN supports resource isolation between slices. NG-RAN\n\nInformation 2:\n### 10.3.1 RAN-CN interface  \n#### 10.3.1.1 General principles  \nThe general principles for the specification of the NG interface are as\nfollows:  \n\\- the NG interface shall be open;  \n\\- the NG interface shall support the exchange of signalling information\nbetween the New RAN and NGC;  \n\\- from a logical standpoint, the NG is a point-to-point interface\nbetween a New RAN node and an NGC node. A point-to-point logical\ninterface shall be feasible even in the absence of a physical direct\nconnection between the New RAN and NGC;  \n\\- the NG interface shall support control plane and user plane\nseparation;  \n\\- the NG interface shall separate Radio Network Layer and Transport\nNetwork Layer;  \n\\- the NG interface shall be future proof to fulfil different new\nrequirements and support of new services and new functions;  \n\\- the NG interface shall be decoupled with the possible New RAN\ndeployment variants;  \n\\- the NG Application Protocol shall support modular procedures design\nand use a syntax allowing optimized encoding /decoding efficiency.  \nNOTE: Whether and how to document the application protocol for NG with\nregards to S1AP will be decided in the normative phase.  \n#### 10.3.1.2 NG Interface Functions  \nNG-C interface supports following functions:  \n\\- Interface management: The functionality to manage the NG-C interface;  \n\\- UE context management: The functionality to manage the UE context\nbetween the RAN and CN;  \nNOTE 1: The UE context information may include roaming and access\nrestriction and security information.  \nNOTE 2: The UE context information may include the information related\nwith network slicing.  \n\\- UE mobility management: The functionality to manage the UE mobility\nfor connected mode between the New RAN and CN;  \n\\- Transport of NAS messages: procedures to transfer NAS messages\nbetween the CN and UE;  \n\\- Paging: The functionality to enable the CN to generate Paging\nmessages sent to the New RAN and to allow the New RAN to page the UE in\n\nInformation 3:\n\\- The NG-RAN supports resource isolation between slices. NG-RAN\nresource isolation may be achieved by means of RRM policies and\nprotection mechanisms that should avoid that shortage of shared\nresources in one slice breaks the service level agreement for another\nslice. It should be possible to fully dedicate NG-RAN resources to a\ncertain slice. Some RACH resources can be associated to specific\nNSAG(s). Other aspects how NG-RAN supports resource isolation is\nimplementation dependent.  \n**Access control**  \n\\- By means of the unified access control (see clause 7.4),\noperator-defined access categories can be used to enable differentiated\nhandling for different slices. NG-RAN may broadcast barring control\ninformation (i.e. a list of barring parameters associated with\noperator-defined access categories) to minimize the impact of congested\nslices.  \n**Slice Availability**  \n\\- Some slices may be available only in part of the network. The NG-RAN\nsupported S-NSSAI(s), NSAG(s) and NSAG related information such as NSAG\nassociated Cell Reselection Priority and/or NSAG associated RACH\nresources are configured by OAM. Awareness in the NG-RAN of the slices\nsupported in the cells of its neighbours may be beneficial for\ninter-frequency mobility in connected mode. In order to support the\nNSAG, the NG-RAN provides the AMF with the NSAG information per TA in\nthe appropriate NG interface management procedures, as specified in TS\n38.413 \\[26\\]. Awareness in the NG-RAN of the NSAG information supported\nin the list(s) of neighbour cells may be configured by OAM, or exchanged\nwith neighbour NG-RAN nodes.It is assumed that the slice availability\ndoes not change within the UE\\'s registration area (see TS 23.501\n\\[3\\]).  \n\\- The NG-RAN and the 5GC are responsible to handle a service request\nfor a slice that may or may not be available in a given area.

Only a PGW may\nadvertise APN level load information.  \nAPN level load control is an optional feature that may be supported when\nthe following pre-condition is applicable.  \n**Pre-Condition:**  \nIn the given network, when the ratio of the configured APN resource to\nthe overall capacity of the PGW is not the same across all the PGWs in\nthe network.  \nNOTE: In other cases, e.g. when all the resources of the PGW are\navailable for all the APNs served by that PGW, the node level load\ninformation is exactly the same as APN level load information, for each\nof its APNs, and hence performing node load control is sufficient.  \nIf APN load control is supported and activated at the PGW, the PGW\nshould advertise the APN load information. If the APN level load control\nfeature is supported at the node performing the PGW selection, i.e. an\nMME, S4-SGSN, ePDG, TWAN, the node shall utilize this information when\nselecting the PGW.  \n#### 12.2.4.2 Justifications for APN load control support  \nFollowing are the justifications to support the APN level load control\nin the network when the pre-condition specified in 12.2.3.1 is\napplicable:  \n**1) To achieve load balancing at the APN level granularity:** The PGW\nmay be configured to handle more than one APN in the network. In such a\ncase, the PGW may be additionally configured to allocate different\nresources for each of the configured APNs, e.g. the PGW may be\nconfigured to handle \\\"X\\\" number of sessions for the \\\"consumer\\\" APN\nand to handle \\\"Y\\\" number of session for the \\\"corporate\\\" APN.

This\nfrequency plan is defined as having three (120\u00b0) sectors per site and\nfour sites per cluster, for a total of 108 sites on the cell plan. It is\nconfigured such that the same sector of every other site is a co-channel\ninterferer. The distance between adjacent base stations was defined\naccording to the assigned multipath channel, in accordance with annex\nV.A.  \nTwo hundred fifty mobile stations were randomly placed over the entire\nsimulation area. In order to simulate an infinite network (and thereby\navoid edge effects), the simulation area was wrapped around so that base\nstations always surrounded every mobile, even those located at the edge.\nThis technique circumvented the problem of having a mobile at the edge\nexperience less interference than one located in the geometrical centre\nof the simulation area.

Therefore, handovers due to quality are not\nsimulated. However, this enables the very evaluation of the handover\nalgorithm, and not the evaluation of the frequency pattern.  \nE.3 Radio Network Model\n=======================  \nThe radio network model represents the network layout. It should allow\nthe definition of the following parameters:  \n\\- Number of layers;  \n\\- Number of cells on each layer;  \n\\- BTS site pattern;  \n\\- BTS separation.  \nThree network model scenarios are proposed.  \nE.3.1 Scenario 1: Hot Spot\n--------------------------  \nOne cell in the upper layer, one cell in the lower layer.  \nE.3.2 Scenario 2: Line of Cells\n-------------------------------  \nTwo cell in the upper layer, 5 cells in the lower layer. Lower layer\ncell distance: 400 m. Upper layer cell distance: 2 km.  \nFigure E.1  \nE.3.3 Scenario 3: Manhattan Coverage\n------------------------------------  \nFour cells in the upper layer, 13 cells in the lower layer. Lower layer\ncell distance between BTS: 400 m. Upper layer cell distance: 2 km. The\ncells in the lower layer are situated at alternate crossings.  \nFigure E.2  \nE.4 Propagation Model\n=====================  \nE.4.1 Upper Layer Path Loss\n---------------------------\n\nInformation 5:\nis changing rapidly in a radio environment of small cells.  \nTo give good performance to all MS, the network has to be built up using\ncells of different sizes at one place, i.e. a hierarchical cell\nstructure. The network provides a multi-coverage. Dependent on the MS\nspeed, the MS shall be handled by a cell with a suitable size.  \nThe procedures to achieve this for an MS in idle mode are described in\nGSM03.22\\[1\\].  \nThe radio link control procedures in the concept of a hierarchical cell\nstructure are independent of the connections to MSC and BSC.  \nIn the following the procedures to handle MS in connected mode for a\nhierarchical cell structure are given.  \nB.2 Definitions\n===============  \nB.2.1 Categories of cells\n-------------------------  \nA hierarchical cell structure is built up from different layers of\ncells. The structure shall allow at least three layers: the lower layer,\nthe middle layer and the upper layer(see note). If only two layers are\nplanned, the lower layer and middle layer are used. It is emphasized\nthat the relation to other cells determines the assignment to a layer in\nthe hierarchical cell structure. The absolute size of a cell is not a\ncriterion.  \nNOTE 1: An example for the use of middle and upper layer is as follows:  \n\\- Middle layer: Layer with sufficient capacity to handle the traffic\nfor fast moving MS.  \n\\- Upper layer: \\\"Umbrella Cells\\\" of the middle layer, here only\nhandover traffic shall be supported, when cells of the middle layer are\nnot available.  \nThe layer to which a cell in a hierarchical cell structure is assigned\nis set by the O&M-parameter CELL\\_LEVEL.  \nCells that do not belong into a hierarchical structure (single layer)\nhave the CELL\\_LEVEL \\\"standard layer\\\" that is the default level if\ndetails concerning the CELL\\_LEVEL are missing.  \nThe parameter CELL\\_LEVEL has a range from 0 to 15(see note) and is\nallocated for each radio cell. The coding is given in clauseB.5. In\n\nQuestion: What is the main issue with the cell association pattern in a multi-BS network for cellular-connected UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)?\nOptions:\noption 1: The need for multi-SIM technology.\noption 2: The nulls in the BS's antenna pattern.\noption 3: The strong interference from neighboring cells.\noption 4: The fragmented cell association pattern.\noption 5: The rapid fluctuation of the received signal power.\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer option 3: The strong interference from neighboring cells.\n"

Each cluster consists of a number of\nRayleigh-fading paths, plus a possible non-fading path to get Rice\nfading.  \nOf interest here are mainly the properties 4 and 7 in Table A.2. For\nthis case, a full description of the channel is given by specifying the\nparameter set (Figure A.1):  \n![](media/image14.wmf){width=\"1.1388888888888888in\"\nheight=\"0.2916666666666667in\"}  \nThe i:th cluster is described by its total power Pi, the delay of the\nfirst path \u03c4I and the cluster delay spread \u03c3\u03c4,i.

We propose a set of models with fixed parameters as shown\nin Table A.3. The selected parameters correspond to the COST 207/GSM\n\nInformation 2:\n> $G_{\\text{BS}}(\\theta_{n,m,\\text{AoD}})$ and\n> $G_{\\text{MS}}(\\theta_{n,m,\\text{AoA}})$.  \n**Step 13:** Apply the path loss based on the BS to MS distance from\nStep 2, and the log normal shadow fading determined in step 3 as bulk\nparameters to each of the sub-path powers of the channel model.  \n**Notes:**  \nNote 1: In the development of the Spatial Channel Model, care was taken\nto include the statistical relationships between Angles and Powers, as\nwell as Delays and Powers. This was done using the proportionality\nfactors\n$r_{\\text{DS}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{delays}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{DS}}}$ and\n$r_{\\text{AS}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{AoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{PAS}}}$ that\nwere based on measurements.  \nNote 2: While there is some evidence that delay spread may depend on\ndistance between the transmitter and receiver, the effect is considered\nto be minor (compared to other dependencies: DS-AS, DS-SF.). Various\ninputs based on multiple data sets indicate that the trend of DS can be\neither slightly positive or negative, and may sometimes be relatively\nflat with distance. For these reasons and also for simplicity, a\ndistance dependence on DS is not modeled.  \nNote 3: The equations presented here for the power of the *n*th path are\nbased on a power-delay envelope which is the average behavior of the\npower-delay profile. Defining the powers to reproduce the average\nbehavior limits the dynamic range of the result and does not reproduce\nthe expected randomness from trial to trial. The randomizing process\n$\\xi_{n}$is used to vary the powers with respect to the average envelope\nto reproduce the variations experienced in the actual channel. This\nparameter is also necessary to produce a dynamic range comparable to\nmeasurements.  \nNote 4: The quantity $r_{\\text{AS}}$ describes the distribution of\npowers in angle and\n$r_{\\text{AS}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{AoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{PAS}}}$, i.e.\nthe spread of angles to the power weighted angle spread.

Path powers follow the\nexponential channel shapes in the COST 259 model. The delay spreads for\neach model are close to expected medians when applying the COST 259\nmodel in reasonably sized macrocells. In the rural model a direct path\nis present, resulting in Rice-type fading when filtered to wideband\nchannels. The hilly terrain model consists of two clusters, a typical\nsituation in these environments.  \nWith the chosen parameters the models will be quite similar to the GSM\nchannel models \\[2\\], after filtering to the GSM bandwidth.  \nIn Section 5, the channel models are specified explicitly. The tap\ndelays have been determined by generating 20 independent identically\ndistributed values from a uniform distribution in the interval, where\n*\u03c3\u03c4* is the rms delay spread. For the Hilly Terrain channel 10 paths\nhave been generated for each cluster and for the Rural Area model there\nis a total of 10 taps. Relative powers have then been calculated using\nthe channel shapes in Annex A, Table A.3. The channels have been\nnormalised so that the total power in each channel is equal to one.  \n5 Channel model descriptions\n============================  \nRadio wave propagation in the mobile environment can be described by\nmultiple paths which arise due to reflection and scattering in the\nmobile environment.

Taking image classification\nfor instance, the training set includes correctly-classified images.\nWhen training a network, the weights are usually updated using a\nhill-climbing optimization process called gradient descent. The gradient\nindicates how the weights should change in order to reduce the loss (the\ngap between the correct outputs and the outputs computed by the DNN\nbased on its current weights). The training process is repeated\niteratively to continuously reduce the overall loss \\[25\\]. Until the\nloss is below a predefined threshold, the DNN with high precision is\nobtained.  \nThere are multiple ways to train the network for different targets. The\nintroduced above is supervised learning which uses the labelled training\nsamples to find the correct outputs for a task. Unsupervised learning\nuses the unlabelled training samples to find the structure or clusters\nin the data. Reinforcement learning can be used to output what action\nthe agent should take next to maximize expected rewards. Transfer\nlearning is to adjust the previously-trained weights (e.g. weights in a\nglobal model) using a new training set, which is used for a faster or\nmore accurate training for a personalized model \\[25\\].  \nAfter a DNN is trained, it can perform its task by computing the output\nof the network using the weights determined during the training process,\nwhich is referred to as ***inference***. In the model inference process,\nthe inputs from the real world are passed through the DNN. Then the\nprediction for the task is output, as shown in Figure A.3-1. For\ninstance, the inputs can be pixels of an image, sampled amplitudes of an\naudio wave or the numerical representation of the state of some system\nor game. Correspondingly, the outputs of the network can be a\nprobability that an image contains a particular object, the probability\nthat an audio sequence contains a particular word or a bounding box in\n\nInformation 2:\ncomputational neural network. The neurons in the input layer receive\nsome values and propagate them to the neurons in the middle layer of the\nnetwork, which is also called a \"hidden layer\". The weighted sums from\none or more hidden layers are ultimately propagated to the output layer,\nwhich presents the final outputs of the network \\[25\\].  \n![](media/image32.jpeg){width=\"2.220138888888889in\" height=\"1.3125in\"}\n![](media/image33.jpeg){width=\"2.1381944444444443in\"\nheight=\"1.9673611111111111in\"}  \n(a) \\(b\\)  \nFigure A.2-1. Architecture of neuron and neural network  \nNeural networks having more than three layers, i.e., more than one\nhidden layer are called ***deep neural networks (DNN)***. In contrast to\nthe conventional shallow-structured NN architectures, DNNs, also\nreferred to as deep learning, made amazing breakthroughs since 2010s in\nmany essential application areas because they can achieve human-level\naccuracy or even exceed human accuracy. Deep learning techniques use\nsupervised and/or unsupervised strategies to automatically learn\nhierarchical representations in deep architectures for classification\n\\[26\\]. With a large number of hidden layers, the superior performance\nof DNNs comes from its ability to extract high-level features from raw\nsensory data after using statistical learning over a large amount of\ndata to obtain an effective representation of an input space \\[25\\]. In\nrecent years, thanks to the big data obtained from the real world, the\nrapidly increased computation capacity and continuously-evolved\nalgorithms, DNNs have become the most popular ML models for many AI\napplications.  \nA.3 Training and inference\n--------------------------  \n***Training*** is a process in which a AI/ML model learns to perform its\ngiven tasks, more specifically, by optimizing the value of the weights\nin the DNN. A DNN is trained by inputting a training set, which are\noften correctly-labelled training samples.

These shall be extended for the component carriers of\nLTE-Advanced considering support of carrier aggregation.  \n12 Mobility enhancements\n========================  \nAs LTE Rel-8, LTE-Advanced supports mobility across the cellular network\nand is optimized for low mobile speed from 0 to 15 km/h. Higher mobile\nspeed between 15 and 120 km/h are also supported with high performance.\nMobility across the cellular network can be maintained at speeds from\n120 km/h to 350 km/h (or even up to 500 km/h depending on the frequency\nband). The impact of intra LTE-Advanced handovers on quality (e.g.\ninterruption time) is less than or equal to that provided by handovers\nin LTE. LTE-Advanced also support techniques and mechanisms to optimize\ndelay and packet loss during intra system handover:  \n\\- The subframe size of 1 ms makes LTE-Advanced capable of adapting to\nfast changing radio link conditions and allows exploitation of multiuser\ndiversity;  \n\\- The use of scheduled and diversity resource allocation in the\nfrequency domain allows optimisation for various speeds, i.e., the\ndiversity resource allocation increases frequency diversity gain at high\nspeeds, whereas the scheduled resource allocation increases multiuser\ndiversity gain at low speeds;  \n\\- Forwarding of the data buffered in the source eNB to the target eNB\nprevents packet loss at handovers;  \n\\- The measurements for intra-frequency neighbour cells are performed\nwithout gaps, hence without wasting radio resources. The relevant\nmeasurements for neighbour cells that operate on a different carrier\nfrequency from the currently served frequency, are performed during\ntransmission/reception gaps provided by DTX/DRX, or by the packet\nscheduler.  \n13 TS 36.133 \\[17\\] requirements enhancements\n=============================================  \nAs already in LTE Rel-8 and also in LTE-Advanced robust general minimum\n\nInformation 2:\n|                  |     component carrier can be divided into        |\n|                  |     several bandwidth parts.

The client shall start the quota holding timer\nwhen quota consumption ceases. This is always when traffic ceases, i.e.\nthe timer is re-started at the end of each packet. It applies equally to\nthe granted time quota and to the granted volume quota. The timer is\nstopped on sending a CCR and re-initialised on receiving a CCA with the\nprevious used value or a new value of Quota-Holding-Time AVP if\nreceived.  \nAlternatively, if this AVP is not present, a locally configurable\ndefault value in the client shall be used.\\\nA Quota-Holding-Time AVP value of zero indicates that this mechanism\nshall not be used.  \n#### 6.5.1.2 Change of charging conditions  \nThere are a number of mid-session service events (re-authorization\ntriggers), which could affect the rating of the current service usage,\ne.g. end user QoS changes or location updates. When allocating\nresources, the server may instruct the Credit-Control client to\nre-authorize the quota upon a number of different session related\ntriggers that can affect the rating conditions. The server instruct the\nNetwork Element to monitor for such events by using the Trigger AVP\ncontaining one or more Trigger-Type AVPs in the CCA command. These\nevents are in addition to the static triggers defined in the service\nspecific document (middle tier TS).  \nOnce the OCS has armed one or more triggers using the Trigger AVP at the\nNetwork Element, these triggers shall remain in effect until another\nTrigger AVP is received for the same Rating Group, where the Network\nElement shall arm all triggers present in the Trigger AVP and reset all\nother triggers. The presence of the Trigger AVP without any Trigger-Type\n\nInformation 4:\nalso the accumulated price for the consumed service and the requested\nservice in the current quota. The price is used by the OCF to determine\nif additional account balance reservation is needed.  \nService denial is being handled in the same manner as in the\nTariffRequest scenario (see clause 6.2.2.2.2 for details).\\\nIf the service was not delivered at all for any reason, an explicit\nservice usage request with a release request subtype is send from the\nOCF to the RF.  \nAfter the first service usage request, subsequent service usage request\nmessages can take into account the account balance and the applied\ntariff and try to optimize the monetary quota in order to minimize the\nnumber of service usage requests. The monetary quota is bounded by the\naccount balance. Requesting service usage for a very low monetary quota\ncan result in a small amount of granted service units. In this case, the\nSBCF may decide to deny the service and close the session with the\nactual number of service units consumed.  \nThe allowed units are calculated as if consumed in the highest tariff\navailable for the subscriber (e.g. if the volume tariff is time\ndependent, the price is calculated as if the volume was consumed solely\nduring the higher rate period). If the tariff is not time dependent, but\nvolume dependent, the tariff steps is taken into account in advance.  \nAt the final service usage request message (with the debit indication),\nthe counters are updated and the final service price is returned. The\nOCF is responsible to free any extra reservations made.  \n6.3 Sy message flows\n--------------------  \nAs defined in the TS 23.203 \\[206\\] for subscriber spending limits,\npolicy counters are maintained in the OCS. The PCRF can make policy\ndecisions based on the status of the policy counters. The OCS reports\npolicy counter status values when requested by the PCRF and notifies the\nPCRF of status changes.  \nFigure 6.3.1 illustrates a simple example of a single policy counter\n\nInformation 5:\n### 3.2.2 Inadequately handled call attempts  \n#### 3.2.2.1 Definition  \nInadequately handled call attempts are attempts which are blocked (as\ndefined in ITU-T E.600 series of Recommendations) or are excessively\ndelayed within the exchange. \\\"Excessive delays\\\" are those that are\ngreater than three times the \\\"0,95 probability of not exceeding\\\"\nvalues recommended in the tables.  \nFor originating and transit calls, this inadequately handled call\nattempt parameter applies only when there is at least one appropriate\noutlet available.  \n#### 3.2.2.2 Probability of inadequately handled call attempts occurring  \nThe values in table 2 are recommended.  \nTable 2  \n-------------------- ------------------ ------------------\nType of connection   Reference Load A   Reference load B\nInternal             \u226410-2              \u22644 x 10-2\nOriginating          \u22645 x 10-3          \u22643 x 10-2\nTerminating          \u22642 x 10-3          \u22642 x 10-2\nTransit              \u226410-3              \u226410-2\n-------------------- ------------------ ------------------\n\nQuestion: What is the classical retrial policy?\nOptions:\noption 1: Each blocked customer stays in the orbit for an exponentially distributed time independently of other customers\noption 2: Blocked customers wait until being served\noption 3: Retrial rate is constant and does not depend on the number of customers in the orbit\noption 4: Retrial rate is proportional to the number of customers in the orbit\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 1: Each blocked customer stays in the orbit for an exponentially distributed time independently of other customers\n"

Deep learning techniques use\nsupervised and/or unsupervised strategies to automatically learn\nhierarchical representations in deep architectures for classification\n\\[26\\].

Taking image classification\nfor instance, the training set includes correctly-classified images.\nWhen training a network, the weights are usually updated using a\nhill-climbing optimization process called gradient descent. The gradient\nindicates how the weights should change in order to reduce the loss (the\ngap between the correct outputs and the outputs computed by the DNN\nbased on its current weights). The training process is repeated\niteratively to continuously reduce the overall loss \\[25\\]. Until the\nloss is below a predefined threshold, the DNN with high precision is\nobtained.  \nThere are multiple ways to train the network for different targets. The\nintroduced above is supervised learning which uses the labelled training\nsamples to find the correct outputs for a task. Unsupervised learning\nuses the unlabelled training samples to find the structure or clusters\nin the data. Reinforcement learning can be used to output what action\nthe agent should take next to maximize expected rewards. Transfer\nlearning is to adjust the previously-trained weights (e.g. weights in a\nglobal model) using a new training set, which is used for a faster or\nmore accurate training for a personalized model \\[25\\].  \nAfter a DNN is trained, it can perform its task by computing the output\nof the network using the weights determined during the training process,\nwhich is referred to as ***inference***. In the model inference process,\nthe inputs from the real world are passed through the DNN. Then the\nprediction for the task is output, as shown in Figure A.3-1. For\ninstance, the inputs can be pixels of an image, sampled amplitudes of an\naudio wave or the numerical representation of the state of some system\nor game. Correspondingly, the outputs of the network can be a\nprobability that an image contains a particular object, the probability\nthat an audio sequence contains a particular word or a bounding box in\n\nInformation 4:\nthat an audio sequence contains a particular word or a bounding box in\nan image around an object or the proposed action that should be taken\n\\[25\\].  \n![](media/image34.jpeg){width=\"3.1875in\" height=\"0.9048611111111111in\"}  \nFigure A.3-1. Example of AI/ML inference  \nThe performance of DNNs is gained at the cost of high computational\ncomplexity. Hence more efficient compute engines are often used, e.g.\ngraphics processing units (GPU) and network processing units (NPU).\nCompared to the inference which only involves the feedforward process,\nthe training often requires more computation and storage resources\nbecause it involves also the backpropagation process \\[10\\].  \nA.4 Widely-used DNN models and algorithms\n-----------------------------------------  \nMany DNN models have been developed over the past two decades. Each of\nthese models has a different \"network architecture\" in terms of number\nof layers, layer types, layer shapes (i.e., filter size, number of\nchannels and filters), and connections between layers \\[25\\]. Figure\nA.4-1 presents three popular structures of DNNs: multilayer perceptrons\n(MLPs), convolution neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs). ***Multilayer perceptrons (MLP)*** model is the most\nbasic DNN, which is composed of a series of fully connected layers\n\\[41\\]. In a fully connected layer, all outputs are connected to all\ninputs, as shown in Figure A.4-1. Hence MLP requires a significant\namount of storage and computation.  \n![](media/image35.jpeg){width=\"3.576388888888889in\"\nheight=\"1.3347222222222221in\"}  \nFigure A.4-1. MLP DNN model  \nAn approach to limiting the number of weights that contribute to an\noutput is to calculate the output only using a function of a fixed-size\nwindow of inputs. An extremely popular window-based DNN model uses a\nconvolution operation to structure the computation, hence is named as\n***convolution neural network (CNN)*** \\[25\\].

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### B3.2 Traffic Monitoring  \nMobiles in automobiles on freeways anonymously sampled to determine\naverage velocity of vehicles. Congestion detected and reported.  \nCongestion, average flow rates, vehicle occupancy and related traffic\ninformation can be gathered from a variety of sources including roadside\ntelematic sensors, roadside assistance organizations and ad-hoc reports\nfrom individual drivers. In addition, average link speeds can be\ncomputed through anonymous random sampling of UE locations.  \n#### B3.2.1 Attributes  \n##### B3.2.1.1 Privacy  \nAnonymous sampling of target UE requires all unique information relating\nto the UE location to be retained by the network operator. Depending on\nthe capabilities of the location method (ref. section 3.4) traffic\nbehavior described above can only be determined if a UE is sampled at\nleast twice within a finite predetermined period.  \nThe UE identification must be sufficiently unique to allow time\nseparated measurements to be paired before discarding the source UE\nidentification.  \nThe level of uniqueness can be a highly truncated form of the UE-IMSI\n(or equivalent). For example, maintaining 1000 unattached location\nestimates for subsequent pairing with future estimates will only require\n3 least significant digits of the IMSI. Ambiguity in matching will occur\nbut at a low (detectable) rate. Finally, all unattached estimates can be\nset to expire after a preset time.  \nB4 Enhanced Call Routing\n------------------------  \nEnhanced Call Routing (ECR) allows subscriber or user calls to be routed\nto the closest service client based on the location of the originating\nand terminating calls of the user. The user may optionally dial a\nfeature or service code to invoke the service (\\*GAS for closest gas\nstation, etc).  \nIn addition to routing the call based on location, ECR should be capable\nof delivering the location information to the associated service client.\nFor example, this capability may be needed for services such as\n\nInformation 2:\n### 6.6.1 General  \nIf a UE is using the same identity in several broadcast messages, it is\npossible to track the vehicle and compromise its privacy. Whether such\nprivacy concerns exist for a V2X service will likely depend on regional\nregulatory requirements and/or operator policy, hence the PC5 privacy\nfeature is optional to use. For example, a service that is mandated for\nuse by a regulator may not provide an \\\"opt out\\\" option.  \nNo additional privacy features beyond the regular LTE privacy features\n(see TS 33.401 \\[12\\]) are supported for Uu mode V2X communications.  \nNOTE 1: The specification does not provide technical solutions to\naddress any privacy concerns specific to V2X service that require\nprivacy for a UE being attached to the network, or that due to the data\ntraversing the network in Uu mode. However, there are general privacy\nprinciples applicable outside of 3GPP scope; data minimization and user\nconsent if privacy impacting data collection is unavoidable for\nproviding the V2X service.  \nNOTE 2: Even if out of scope of 3GPP, bilateral agreements between\noperator, V2X service provider, and V2X-UE might be able to address\nregional regulator privacy concerns.  \nPrivacy may be supported at the application layer by employing\nidentifiers and credentials that are not linked to long-term UE or user\nidentifiers. These credentials would be refreshed periodically. The\nchange of application layer identities and credentials for using the V2X\nservice is out of scope in 3GPP.\n\nInformation 3:\ncarefully studied by the EU article 29 committee and found to be in\naccordance with the current EU privacy requirements. It is stressed,\nhowever, that it is the responsibility of someone implementing or\ndeploying a system in accordance with the Liberty Alliance\nspecifications to comply with EU directives and requirements on privacy.  \nFor roaming cases clause9.1.1 in this specification describes the cases\nwhere the pseudonym contains the address(es) of the target UE\\'s\nHome-GMLC so that the Requesting-GMLC can forward the location request\nto H-GMLC, which may determine the corresponding verinym itself or\nrequest the verinym from its associated PMD.  \n########  Annex F (Informative): Mechanism for performing Change of Area Event Detection  \nNote: the classification (i.e. normative or informative) of this Annex\nis FFS.  \nAs described in clause9.1.9 that there may be alternative mechanisms to\ntransfer the deferred MT-LR with Area Event request to the UE. This\nannex illustrates one mechanism. In this mechanism a Short Message\nService (SMS) is used to transfer, to the UE/(U)SIM, the Area event\ndetection request via an (U)SIM Application Toolkit application.  \nF.1 (U)SIM Application Toolkit (USAT) Based Solution\n====================================================  \nIn this (U)SAT based solution, the area event detection mechanism relies\non the proactive control of the UE by the (U)SIM using the (U)SAT\ncommands controlled by a specific Change of Area Deferred Location\napplication. Figure F.1 illustrates one possible method for downloading\na change of area event application to the UE, but does not detail the\noperation of the application. The details of the application is outside\nthe scope of this specification. Further information about the possible\n(U)SAT commands, can be found from TS31.111\\[37\\].  \nThe following procedure (shown in Figure F.1) replaces Figure 9.6d in\nclause9.1.9.  \nFigure F.1: (U)SAT Application Download and Change of Area Event\nDetection Procedure\n\nInformation 4:\n### 9.2.1 Automotive  \n#### 9.2.1.1 Road-level identification and road-user charging  \nPositioning integrity is a key input to determining whether a road\nvehicle is traveling on a highway or a neighbouring access road (e.g., a\ncollector-distributor lane). For example, consider a manufacturer\nwanting to ensure their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) only\nactivates when the vehicle is on a highway. This requires the UE to\ndetermine with a high degree of positioning integrity which road the\nvehicle is traveling on, in order to avoid the potential for unintended\nADAS functionality on the access road (or conversely to ensure the\nappropriate functionality has been activated on the highway). The road\nvehicle may also be subject to road-user charging with fees that vary\ndepending which road is used, also requiring positioning integrity\nvalidation.  \nConsider an access road that is within 3 metres of a freeway, with a\ncorresponding AL of 3 metres and TIR of 1 x10^-7^/hr specified by the\nvehicle manufacturer. The road vehicle connects to a positioning\nintegrity service provider via the mobile network to request UE-Based\npositioning integrity assistance data. The assistance data is applied by\nthe UE alongside its local positioning measurements in order to compute\nthe real-time PL. So long as the PL remains below the AL, the\npositioning system is available and functioning as intended, and the\nroad-level identification can be made safely. If the PL exceeds the AL,\nthe impacted positioning system should be declared unavailable on the\nvehicle and a road-level determination is not possible. For example, a\nnetwork-detected fault can be flagged in the positioning integrity\nassistance data, resulting in a larger PL computed by the UE.  \nAnother important positioning integrity aspect to take into account in\nroad-user charging and other applications (like pay how you drive\ninsurances) is that, because of their intrinsic nature, they have to be\n\nInformation 5:\n**Road Side Unit:** A stationary infrastructure entity supporting V2X\napplications that can exchange messages with other entities supporting\nV2X applications.  \nNOTE: RSU is a term frequently used in existing ITS specifications, and\nthe reason for introducing the term in the 3GPP specifications is to\nmake the documents easier to read for the ITS industry. RSU is a logical\nentity that supports V2X application logic using the functionality\nprovided by either a 3GPP network or an UE (referred to as UE-type RSU).  \n**Pseudonymity**: The condition when the processing of personally\nidentifiable information is such the data can no longer be attributed to\na specific subscriber without the use of additional information, as long\nas such additional information is kept separately and subject to\ntechnical and organisational measures to ensure non-attribution to an\nidentified or identifiable subscriber.  \n3.2 Abbreviations\n-----------------  \nFor the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in\n3GPP TR21.905 \\[1\\] and the following apply.

The precoding weights are\ndetermined by the serving cells and the PCI feedback is carried on an\nF-DPCH-like channel, F-TPICH. Additionally, the serving Node B can use\nthe same HS-SCCH orders as in CLTD, where rank2 transmission is possible\nif CLTD activation state is 1;  \n\\- When performing rank2 transmissions, there are two additional UL\nchannels: secondary E-DPCCH (S-E-DPCCH) and secondary E-DPDCH\n(S-E-DPDCHs). The primary and the secondary streams are transmitted\nusing 2xSF2+2xSF4 channelization codes;  \n\\- The DPCCH, HS-DPCCH, E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH are pre-coded\nwith the primary pre-coding vector. The S-DPCCH and S-E-DPDCH are\npre-coded with the secondary pre-coding vector, which is orthogonal to\nthe primary one;  \n\\- The power offsets between the DPCCH and the S-DPCCH and between the\nDPCCH and the S-E-DPCCH are configurable by RRC;  \n\\- The rank indication and offset controlling the presence and the data\nrate of the second stream are sent to the UE from the serving E-DCH cell\nby using E-DCH Rank and Offset Channel (E-ROCH) channel;  \n\\- The E-AGCH and E-ROCH channels can be independently configured with a\nchannelization code and E-RNTI with a possibility to code multiplex them\nor time multiplex on one code with different E-RNTIs;  \n\\- The two transport blocks are acknowledged independently using the\nE-HICH channel, where two different signatures are

services. User data\npackets should be successfully delivered within certain time constraints\nto satisfy the end users requirements.  \nLatency could be impacted by the network capability and network\nconfigurations, e.g. configuration of service priority, RAN capacity,\nnetwork load, number of re-transmissions, Wireless channel environment\nand the processing time of the network functions, etc. These factors may\nbe the root cause if the latency requirements cannot be achieved. Packet\ntransmission latency may dynamically change if one or multiple of these\nfactors change. The latency requirement should be assured even if some\nof the network conditions may degrade. There are some mechanisms to\nassure latency, e.g. to upgrade the service priority, allocate or\nreserve more network resource, prepare backups.  \nWith regard to latency analysis for URLLC services, the performance data\nand fault data are required to be collected, reported and analysed in\nnear real time. Distributed MDAS deployment architecture should be\napplied for this scenario. The domain MDAS producers located in the edge\nnetwork provides latency analysis or predictions for local services in\nnear real time. E.g. for latency and other related QoS evaluation or\nprediction for V2X application, user location and user trajectory may\nneed to be analysed in near-real time. The analytics report can be\nconsumed by edge AFs to perform actions in time. The centralized MDAS\nproducers analyses integrate latency performance for cross domain. It\nmay provide more comprehensive analytics report to the centralized AF.\nAI/ML models or analytics data may need to be exchanged between the\nneighbouring domain MDAS producers, or between domain MDAS producers and\nthe centralized MDAS producers.  \nFrom the management perspective, resource configuration and allocation\n\nInformation 5:\n> training process on the achievable UL data rate, latency and\n> reliability for reporting the trained updates, and the achievable UL\n> data rate, latency and reliability for distributing the model for\n> training in next iteration.

The environmental impact of 5G needs to stay under\ncontrol, and novel solutions to improve network energy savings need to\nbe developed.  \nEnergy consumption has become a key part of the operators\\' OPEX.\nAccording to the report from GSMA \\[3\\], the energy cost on mobile\nnetworks accounts for \\~23% of the total operator cost. Most of the\nenergy consumption comes from the radio access network and in particular\nfrom the AAU, with data centres and fibre transport accounting for a\nsmaller share. The power consumption of a radio access can be split into\ntwo parts: the dynamic part which is only consumed when data\ntransmission/reception is ongoing, and the static part which is consumed\nall the time to maintain the necessary operation of the radio access\ndevices, even when the data transmission/reception is not on-going.  \nTherefore, there is a need to study and develop a network energy\nconsumption model especially for the base station (a UE power\nconsumption model was already defined in TR38.840), KPIs, an evaluation\nmethodology and to identify and study network energy savings techniques\nin targeted deployment scenarios. The study investigates how to achieve\nmore efficient operation dynamically and/or semi-statically and finer\ngranularity adaptation of transmissions and/or receptions in one or more\nof network energy saving techniques in time, frequency, spatial, and\npower domains, with potential support/feedback from UE, potential UE\nassistance information, and information exchange/coordination over\nnetwork interfaces.  \nThe study not only evaluates the potential network energy consumption\ngains, but also assesses and balances the impact on network and user\nperformance, e.g. by looking at KPIs such as spectral efficiency,\ncapacity, UPT, latency, UE power consumption, complexity, handover\nperformance, call drop rate, initial access performance, SLA assurance\n\nInformation 2:\nto be specified in Rel-13, whilst option 2 and option 3 may serve as\nfuture enhancements for new mobile stations combined with the support of\nother features.  \n9 Summary and Conclusions\n=========================  \nThe BTSEnergy study has investigated candidate techniques for BTS energy\nsaving solutions. The major focus in the study was on energy saving in\nregard to RF output power reduction. In particular RF output power\nreduction for the BCCH carrier was investigated for different scenarios\nin regard to traffic load profiles (low load, medium term load and busy\nhour load) and site configurations (three sectorized sites with 2 TRX,\n4TRX and 8 TRX per cells). The study has defined performance objectives\nand compatibility objectives as depicted in clause 5.  \nIn regard to the evaluation of candidate solutions, two performance\nmetrics have been defined, one assessing the savings in cumulated RF\noutput power over all carriers of the cell and one assessing the savings\nin cumulated TRX power consumption over all TRXs of the cell.  \nThe candidate solution \\\"BCCH Carrier Power Reduction Methodology\\\",\ndepicted in clause 7.1, foresees to reduce the transmit power on the\nBCCH carrier for idle timeslots and for timeslots used for traffic\nchannels. Two variants have been investigated, one applying power\nreduction for traffic channels only for DTX silence periods (variant 1)\nand one applying power reduction for traffic channels both for DTX\nsilence and active periods (variant 2). The level of power reduction of\n2 dB against the reference case, not applying any power reduction, was\nevaluated for both variants for different load profiles and different\nsite configurations defined as part of the common assumptions in clause\n6. The candidate has impacts to network KPI. The total handover number\nslightly decreases when it is applied.

The study has not\ninvestigated in detail the implication of CN-related functionalities.  \nFinally, a preliminary feasibility assessment was conducted on the basis\nof the set of design targets in Clause 5. This was by a mixture of\nreference to external sources, characteristics of, or hardware used by,\nother technologies, and companies' own analyses.  \n7.2 Recommendations\n-------------------  \nIt is concluded in preliminary feasibility analysis at TSG-RAN level\nthat Ambient IoT is feasible and beneficial, and further WG-level study\nis recommended prior to normative work.  \nFor the initial WG-level study of Ambient IoT  \n\\- RAN is recommended to down-select further starting from:  \n\\- Deployment scenario 1 with Topology 1  \n\\- Deployment scenario 2 with Topology 1  \n\\- Deployment scenario 2 with Topology 2  \n\\- Deployment scenario 4 with Topology 1  \n\\- Deployment scenario 4 with Topology 3  \n\\- FR1 licensed spectrum is recommended  \n\\- Note: selection or prioritization between FDD and FDD/TDD is to be\ndecided  \n\\- RAN is recommended to down-select to one or more of:  \n\\- Spectrum in-band to NR, in guard-band to LTE/NR, and in standalone\nband(s)  \nIt is recommended to direct the RAN WGs to use the design targets\nreported in Clause 5.

Since massive MIMO is seen as a key technology for NR, the\nrequirements levels must be chosen carefully and careful consideration\nof how they are defined must be undertaken, in order to enable\neconomically viable deployments. This applies for all types of NR\ndeployments, but is of particular importance for massive MIMO nodes\nemploying Active Antenna Systems, or Advanced Antenna Systems in a more\ngeneral sense.  \nIn particular, some RF requirements may need more careful consideration,\nsuch as the out of band emission limits and the maximum ratio between\noverall system power and individual power per RF chain/antenna element.\nIn addition to the implied complexity and cost, the RF requirements must\nbe defined with co-existence and sharing performance in mind and\nrespecting regulatory limits. Particular care has to be taken in how to\ndefine unwanted emission limits with respect to the increasing size of\nthe massive MIMO configuration in a proper way that does not lead to\nexcessively high unwanted emission.\n\nInformation 2:\n5G by utilizing untapped frequency bands above 24 GHz. This abundant\nspectrum can deliver the fastest available speeds, extreme capacity and\nlow latency.  \n3GPP has done several studies on the channel model for frequency\nspectrum above 6GHz, e.g. in TR38.900\\[61\\]. According to\\[59\\],\nextreme higher propagation loss and penetration loss in mmWave spectrum\nis expected, and the frequency is sensitive to blockage, e.g. by foliage\nor the human body. However, again according to \\[59\\], performance tests\nfor mmWAVE provide extraordinary KPIs:  \n\\- 14.7/3 Gbps cell peak throughout (DL/UL) in an 800 MHz spectrum band.  \n\\- One-way user plane latency between 1--1.5ms.  \n\\- Farthest access distance: 2.6km in line-of-sight with a few small\ntrees.  \nAccording to\\[62\\], commercial 5G modems support mmWAVE as well as dual\nconnectivity, and upload speeds of 2.2Gbps can be achieved by the\naggregated Frequency Ranges FR2 400MHz (on n261) and FR1 100MHz (n77).\nAccording to\\[61\\], mmWave bands can accommodate more capacity and\nbandwidth than any other band. And since spectrum in these bands is\nabundant, mmWave spectrum is ideally placed to deliver high speeds, low\nlatency and high capacity, all at the same time. The short wavelength of\nmmWave allows for very small antennas, which helps with beam forming for\nenhanced coverage and spectral efficiency. Promoted by the whole\nindustry, 5G mmWAVE commercialization grows rapidly. GSA's report \\[58\\]\nindicates that, up to May2021, twenty-eight operators in sixteen\ncountries/territories are known to be already deploying 5G networks\nusing mmWave spectrum at 24GHz.  \nBased on this analysis, mmWAVE is an attractive technology for\nproduction scenarios that typically rely on fully wired data rates. In\nparticular, interactive video live production scenarios, i.e. video\nproduction with almost real time interaction between video director and\ncameras, require extreme low latency, as they allow camera direction in\n\nInformation 3:\n| MIMO,       |             |             |             |             |\n| Modulation  |             |             |             |             |\n| scheme).

In contrast to\nthe conventional shallow-structured NN architectures, DNNs, also\nreferred to as deep learning, made amazing breakthroughs since 2010s in\nmany essential application areas because they can achieve human-level\naccuracy or even exceed human accuracy. Deep learning techniques use\nsupervised and/or unsupervised strategies to automatically learn\nhierarchical representations in deep architectures for classification\n\\[26\\]. With a large number of hidden layers, the superior performance\nof DNNs comes from its ability to extract high-level features from raw\nsensory data after using statistical learning over a large amount of\ndata to obtain an effective representation of an input space \\[25\\].

The performance indicators for\ntraining mainly include the following aspects:  \n\\- Model training resource performance indicators: the performance\nindicators of the system that the model trains. e.g.\\\"training\nduration\\\" etc.  \n\\- Model performance indicators: performance indicators of the model\nitself, e.g. \\\"accuracy\\\", \\\"precision\\\", \\\"F1 score\\\", etc.  \nTherefore, the MLT MnS producer needs to provide the name(s) of\nsupported performance indicator(s) for the MnS consumer to query and\nselect for ML model performance evaluation. The MnS consumer may also\nneed to provide the performance requirements of the ML model using the\nselected performance indicators.  \nThe MLT MnS producer uses the selected performance indicators for\nevaluating ML model training, and reports with the corresponding\nperformance score in the ML training report when the training is\ncompleted.  \n##### 5.1.10.2.2 Monitoring and control of AI/ML behavior  \nIn a typical network operation, an operator configures and operates an\nML entity according to the corresponding manual of the entity.

Based on the risk level (e.g.unacceptable, high,\nminimal) of the use case, the trustworthiness requirements for ML\ntraining, testing and inference may vary and therefore the related\ntrustworthiness mechanisms need to be configured and monitored. The\npurpose of AI/ML trustworthiness is to ensure that the model being\ntrained, tested, and deployed is explainable, fair and robust.  \nNOTE: In the context of SA5, explainability of a model refers to\nexplaining individual decisions predicted by the model and not\nexplaining the internal behavior of the model itself.  \nThe EU has proposed an AI regulation act for AI/ML consisting of several\nkey requirements that the AI/ML systems should meet (based on the risk\nlevel of the use case) for them to be considered trustworthy \\[10\\].\nThese requirements include, but not limited to human agency and\noversight, technical robustness and safety, privacy and data governance,\ntransparency, diversity, non-discrimination and fairness,\naccountability, societal and environmental well-being. Other\nrequirements and more details on each of these requirements are\ndescribed in \\[11\\]. Furthermore, ISO/IEC analyses the factors that can\nimpact the trustworthiness of systems providing or using AI and possible\napproaches or requirements to improving their trustworthiness that can\nbe used by any business regardless of its size or sector \\[12\\].  \nThree well known categories under the umbrella of Trustworthy Machine\nLearning are as follows:  \n**Explainable Machine Learning:** Explainability in machine learning\nrefers to the ability of ML models to enable humans to understand\ndecisions or predictions made by them.  \n**Fair Machine Learning:** Fairness in machine learning refers to the\nprocess of correcting and eliminating bias in machine learning models.\n\nInformation 2:\ncapability for an authorized MnS consumer to define the reporting\ncharacteristics related to the inference explainability reports of an ML\nentity.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_INF\\_TRUST-3: The producer of AI/ML inference should have a\ncapability to infer using a specific ML entity trained and tested with\nfairness characteristics as defined by the MnS consumer.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_INF\\_TRUST-4: The producer of AI/ML inference should support a\ncapability for an authorized MnS consumer to define the reporting\ncharacteristics related to the inference fairness reports of an ML\nentity.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_INF\\_TRUST-5: The producer of AI/ML inference should have a\ncapability to infer using a specific ML entity trained and tested with\nrobustness characteristics as defined by the MnS consumer.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_INF\\_TRUST-6: The producer of AI/ML inference should support a\ncapability for an authorized MnS consumer to define the reporting\ncharacteristics related to the inference robustness reports of an ML\nentity.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_TEST\\_TRUST-1: The ML assessment MnS producer should support a\ncapability to enable an authorized MnS consumer to request reporting on\nthe supported assessment explainability capabilities of an ML entity.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_TEST\\_TRUST-2: The ML assessment MnS producer should have a\ncapability to test a specific ML entity using assessment data with\nexplainability characteristics as defined by the MnS consumer.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_TEST\\_TRUST-3: The ML assessment MnS producer should support a\ncapability to enable an authorized MnS consumer to define the reporting\ncharacteristics related to the assessment explainability reports of an\nML entity.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_TEST\\_TRUST-4: The ML assessment MnS producer should support a\ncapability to enable an authorized MnS consumer to request reporting on\nthe supported assessment fairness capabilities of an ML entity.**  \n**REQ-ML\\_TEST \\_TRUST-5: The ML assessment MnS producer should have a\ncapability to test a specific ML entity using assessment data with\n\nInformation 3:\nprocess of correcting and eliminating bias in machine learning models.  \n**Robust Machine Learning:** Robustness in machine learning refers to\nthe process of handling various forms of errors/corruptions in machine\nlearning models as well as changes in the underlying data distribution\nin an automatic way.  \nThese features apply to the four aspects of the ML process:  \n\\- Data processing for use towards training, testing and inference.  \n\\- The training of ML entities.  \n\\- The testing of ML entities.  \n\\- The use of ML entities for inference.  \n#### 5.3.1.2 Use cases  \n##### 5.3.1.2.1 AI/ML trustworthiness indicators  \nThe AI/ML trustworthiness indicators related to ML training, testing and\ninference need to be precisely defined. The indicators mainly include\nthree aspects:  \nExplainability-related indicators: the explainability indicators of the\nML entity. For example, the AI/ML MnS consumer may indicate to the AI/ML\nMnS producer to:  \n\\- Provide local explanation for one particular instance predicted by\nthe ML entity without disclosing the ML entity internals.  \n\\- Provide global explanation for a group of instances predicted by the\nML entity without disclosing the ML entity internals.  \n\\- Evaluate monotonicity - a quantitative metric for explainability -\nthat measures the effect of individual features on ML entity performance\nby evaluating the effect on ML entity performance by incrementally\nadding each feature in order of increasing importance.  \nFairness-related indicators: the fairness indicators of the data or the\nML entity. For example, the AI/ML MnS consumer may indicate the AI/ML\nMnS producer to:  \n\\- Evaluate disparate impact - a quantitative measure for fairness -\nthat measures the ratio of rate of favourable outcome for the\nunprivileged group to that of the privileged group.  \n\\- Evaluate Manhattan distance - a quantitative measure for fairness -\nthat measures the average distance between the samples from two\ndatasets.\n\nInformation 4:\n| comprehend the  |             |                 |                 |\n| value, it shall |             |                 |                 |\n| be interpreted  |             |                 |                 |\n| as an           |             |                 |                 |\n| unspecified     |             |                 |                 |\n| rejection       |             |                 |                 |\n| cause.          |             |                 |                 |\n| Unspecifi       |             |                 |                 |\n| ed/unrecognized |             |                 |                 |\n| rejection cause |             |                 |                 |\n| shall be        |             |                 |                 |\n| treated in the  |             |                 |                 |\n| same ways as    |             |                 |                 |\n| the cause value |             |                 |                 |\n| 32 \\\"Request    |             |                 |                 |\n| rejected        |             |                 |                 |\n| (reason not     |             |                 |                 |\n| specified)\\\".   |             |                 |                 |\n+-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n\nInformation 5:\n\\- The ML model can be trained to flip biased outcomes during inference\nusing post-processing fairness techniques, for e.g. based on confidence\nvalue of a prediction.  \n\\- The ML model can be trained to infer well on unseen or missing\ninference data.  \n\\- Perturbing model predictions to obfuscate labels/confidence\ninformation to protect them from model inversion or model extraction\nattacks.  \nDepending on the use case, one or more inference trustworthiness\ntechniques can be applied on the deployed ML model. Therefore, the AI/ML\ninference producer can be queried to provide information on the\nsupported inference trustworthiness capabilities enabling the AI/ML\ninference consumer to request for a subset of supported inference\ntrustworthiness characteristics to be configured, measured, and\nreported.  \n##### 5.3.1.2.5 Assessment of AI/ML trustworthiness  \nThe ML assessment may need to be performed according to the desired\ntrustworthiness measure of the ML model. For example:  \n\\- The ML model can be tested to evaluate the correctness of\nexplanations, quality of explanations, robustness of explanations and\nadaptiveness of explanations.  \n\\- The ML model can be tested to evaluate the robustness of fair\npredictions and adaptiveness of fair predictions.  \n\\- The ML model can be tested to evaluate the correctness of\npredictions, robustness of predictions and adaptiveness of predictions\nfor both adversarial and non-adversarial test samples.  \nDepending on the use case, one or more assessment trustworthiness\ntechniques can be applied during assessment the ML model. Therefore, the\nML assessment producer can be queried to provide information on the\nsupported assessment trustworthiness capabilities enabling the ML\nassessment MnS consumer to request for a subset of supported assessment\ntrustworthiness characteristics to be configured, measured, and\nreported.  \n#### 5.3.1.3 Potential requirements  \n**REQ-ML\\_TRUST\\_IND-1:** The AI/ML MnS producer should have a\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between interpretability and explainability?\nOptions:\noption 1: Interpretability refers to the level at which a model makes sense to a human, while explainability refers to mathematical operations used to clarify the model's internal functions.\noption 2: Interpretability refers to actions or procedures to clarify a model's behavior, while explainability refers to the ability to attach human-understandable meaning to the model's predictions.\noption 3: Interpretability refers to the ability to reproduce consistent results, while explainability refers to the ability to consistently produce the same output for the same input.\noption 4: Interpretability refers to inherent characteristics of a model, while explainability refers to post hoc methods used to explain black box models.\noption 5: Interpretability refers to obtaining consistent results using the same methods, while explainability refers to obtaining consistent results across studies.\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 1: Interpretability refers to the level at which a model makes sense to a human, while explainability refers to mathematical operations used to clarify the model's internal functions.\n"

        "response": "system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 July 2024\n\nuser\n\nRelevant Information:\nInformation 1:\n### 4.2.4 Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (U-TDOA) positioning mechanism  \nThe U-TDOA positioning method is based on network measurements of the\nTime Of Arrival (TOA) of a known signal sent from the mobile and\nreceived at three or more LMUs. The known signal is the normal bursts\ngenerated by a mobile while in the dedicated mode; either on the SDCCH\nor TCH. The method requires LMUs in the geographic vicinity of the\nmobile to be positioned to accurately measure the TOA of the bursts.\nSince the geographical coordinates of the measurement units are known,\nthe mobile position can be calculated via hyperbolic trilateration. This\nmethod will work with existing mobiles without any modification.\n\nInformation 2:\n### 8.3.3 Cell-ID with Angle of Arrival  \nCell-ID with Angle-Of-Arrival (AOA) measurements (1.28 Mcps TDD only):\\\nThis variant uses NodeB angle-of-arrival measurements, usually together\nwith distance related measurements obtained via timing advance to\nestimate the UE location.  \n9 OTDOA positioning method\n==========================  \nThe primary standard OTDOA measurement is the \\\"SFN-SFN observed time\ndifference\\\" observed at the UE (see \\[15\\] and \\[16\\]). These\nmeasurements, together with other information concerning the surveyed\ngeographic position of the transmitters and the RTD of the actual\ntransmissions of the downlink signals may be used to calculate an\nestimate of the position and optionally, the velocity of the UE. Each\nOTDOA measurement for a pair of downlink transmissions describes a line\nof constant difference (a hyperbola (see note 1)) along which the UE may\nbe located. The UE\\'s position is determined by the intersection of\nthese lines for at least two pairs of Node Bs. The accuracy of the\nposition estimates made with this technique depends on the precision of\nthe timing measurements, the relative position of the Node Bs involved\n(see note 2), and is also subject to the effects of multipath radio\npropagation. This is illustrated in the figure 9.1.  \nNOTE 1: This is really a figure in three dimensions, a hyperboloid. For\nconvenience here, this will be simplified to the hyperbola representing\nthe intersection of this surface with the surface of the earth. For\nlocation service in three dimensions the hyperboloid must be considered.  \nNOTE 2: The geometry of the Node B positions may affect the accuracy of\nthe position and optional velocity estimates. The best results are when\nthe Node Bs equally surround the UE. If they do not, there is a\nreduction in accuracy, which is sometimes termed the Geometric Dilution\nof Position (GDP).  \nThe primary OTDOA measurements (made by the UE) are sent to the SRNC.\n\nInformation 3:\n### 4.3.3 OTDOA positioning  \nThe OTDOA positioning method makes use of the measured timing of\ndownlink signals received from multiple TPs, comprising eNBs, ng-eNBs\nand PRS-only TPs, at the UE. The UE measures the timing of the received\nsignals using assistance data received from the positioning server, and\nthe resulting measurements are used to locate the UE in relation to the\nneighbouring TPs.  \nThe operation of the OTDOA method is described in clause 8.2.\n\nInformation 4:\n### 4.3.4 U-TDOA Method  \nThe U-TDOA positioning method is based on network measurements of the\nTime Of Arrival (TOA) of a known signal sent from the UE and received at\nfour or more LMUs. The method requires LMUs in the geographic vicinity\nof the UE to be positioned to accurately measure the TOA of the bursts.\nSince the geographical coordinates of the measurement units are known,\nthe UE position can be calculated via hyperbolic trilateration. This\nmethod will work with existing UE without any modification.  \nThe operation of the U-TDOA location method is described in clause 12.\n\nInformation 5:\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| Positioning method               | RTT for absolute positioning and |\n|                                  | ranging distance                 |\n|                                  |                                  |\n|                                  | RTT+AOA for relative positioning |\n|                                  | and ranging angle                |\n+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n\nQuestion: Which localization technique uses the difference in signals propagation times from an anchor point to the device?\nOptions:\noption 1: AoA\noption 2: ToF\noption 3: RSSI\noption 4: TDoA\noption 5: RToF\nThink step by step and choose the correct option.\nYou must respond in the format 'correct option: <X>', where <X> is the correct letter for the option.assistant\n\nAnswer: option 4: TDoA\n"

Also, relay\nnodes can be used to reduce power consumption of UEs. When a user\ntraffic generated by a UE is relayed by relay nodes, the radio resources\nused between the relay nodes and gNB can be different from the radio\nresource used between the relay nodes and the UEs.  \nIn most cases the relay node is more capable than the UE.

Application layer security has the advantage of easy\naccess to user credentials because it operates in the context of the\nuser, which makes user AAA services easier to implement. Also, an\napplication can be extended for security without having to depend on the\noperating system to provide these services.  \nThe disadvantage of application level security is that security\nmechanisms must be designed independently for every application that\nneeds to be secured. Thus, it is very difficult to create seamless and\nscalable security architectures using only application layer security.  \n[Transport Layer Security]{.underline}  \nTransport layer security provides security services at the Transport\nlayer (Layer 4). SSL, which has been revised and standardized by the\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as TLS, is the security protocol\nthat provides security at the transport layer.  \nA single SSL/TLS instance can be used to create multiple SSL/TLS\nsessions through an Internet protocol (IP) network to provide security\nfor various applications. Modifications are required to each application\nto allow that application to request SSL/TLS security services. SSL/TLS\nis the de-facto standard for Web-based HTTP traffic, and all standard\nWeb browsers include built-in SSL/TLS technology.  \nBecause SSL/TLS technology does not operate in the context of the user,\nobtaining user context is difficult, making it harder to implement user\nAAA services. SSL/TLS is applicable only to TCP traffic and cannot be\nused to protect UDP traffic.  \n[Network Layer Security]{.underline}  \nNetwork layer security provides security services at the Network layer\n(Layer 3). The IETF IPsec Suite is the security protocol that provides\nsecurity at the network layer.

SVC enhances H.264/AVC with a set\nof new profiles and encoding tools that may be used to produce scalable\nbitstreams. SVC supports three different types of scalability: spatial\nscalability, temporal scalability, and quality scalability. Temporal\nscalability is realized using the already existing reference picture\nselection flexibility in H.264/AVC as well as bi-directionally predicted\nB-pictures. The prediction dependencies of B-pictures are arranged in a\nhierarchical structure. Furthermore, appropriate rate control is used to\nadjust the bit budget of each picture to be proportional to its temporal\nimportance in a procedure called quantization parameter cascading. The\nslightly and gradually reduced picture quality of the hierarchical\nB-pictures has been shown not to significantly impact the subjective\nquality and the watching experience, while showing high compression\nefficiency. Figure 1 shows an example of the realization of temporal\nscalability using hierarchical B-pictures. The example shows 4 different\ntemporal levels, resulting in one base layer and 3 temporal enhancement\nlayers. This allows the frame rate to be scaled by a factor up to 8\n(e.g. from 60Hz to 7.5Hz). This approach has the drawback that it\nincurs a relatively high decoding delay that is exponentially\nproportional to the number of temporal layers, since the pictures have\nto be decoded in a different order than their display order. As the\ncoding gain also diminishes with the increasing number of hierarchy\nlevels, it is not appropriate to generate a high number of temporal\nlayers. An alternative to the above mentioned approach for temporal\nscalability is the use of low-delay uni-directional prediction\nstructures, hence avoiding the out-of-display-order decoding at the cost\nof reduced coding efficiency.\n\nInformation 5:\n### 6.1.1 Enabling Codecs and Formats  \n#### 6.1.1.1 Scalable Video Coding  \n##### 6.1.1.1.1 Introduction  \nScalable Video Coding (SVC) \\[3\\] has been defined as an extension to\nthe H.264/AVC \\[3\\] video coding standard.
