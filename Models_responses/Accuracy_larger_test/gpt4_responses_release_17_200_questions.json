        "response": "To determine the purpose of UE history information in EN-DC (E-UTRA NR Dual Connectivity), we need to analyze the provided information.\n\n1. **Understanding UE History Information**: According to Information 3, the UE history information is collected and stored by the source NG-RAN node for as long as the UE stays in its cells. This history includes mobility data related to the PCell and PSCell, and it is used in subsequent handover preparations.\n\n2. **Handover Preparations**: The UE history information aids in handover preparations by providing the target NG-RAN node with a list of previously visited cells and associated information. This is crucial for making informed decisions about where to handover the UE, as it helps in understanding the UE's movement patterns and past connections.\n\n3. **Avoiding Ping Pong Effect**: One of the common challenges during handovers is the \"Ping Pong effect,\" where a UE frequently switches back and forth between two cells, which can lead to poor user experience and resource wastage. By utilizing UE history information, the network can make better handover decisions that take into account the UE's previous cell connections, thereby helping to minimize the chances of this effect.\n\n4. **Comparing Options**:\n   - **Option 1** (Optimize inter-system load balancing): While UE history information can assist in load balancing, its primary role seems more focused on handover processes rather than balancing loads between systems.\n   - **Option 2** (Enhance coverage and cell edge interference): UE history information does not directly enhance coverage or interfere with cell edge performance; it is more about the handover process.\n   - **Option 3** (Avoid Ping Pong effect during handovers): This aligns with the purpose of using UE history information to prevent frequent and unnecessary handovers.\n   - **Option 4** (Improve mobility optimization): While related, it is broader and less specific than the direct benefit of avoiding the Ping Pong effect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate purpose of UE history information in EN-DC is to avoid the Ping Pong effect during handovers.\n\nThus, the correct option is: \n\ncorrect option: 3"

The process described in Information 2 indicates that for non-supporting UEs, after they perform an initial registration attempt, the shared network selects an operator from the available CN operators.\n3. The UE cannot decode the shared network information, which means it cannot select a core network operator itself. Instead, the network handles this selection.\n4. The RAN selects the CN node based on the NRI if present or by random selection, indicating that the network takes the lead in this process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option that describes how a non-supporting UE selects a core network operator is:\n\n**Option 2: The shared network selects an operator for the UE.**\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\ncorrect option: 2"

        "response": "To determine how RACH configuration conflict is resolved in a split gNB architecture, we can analyze the relevant information provided.\n\nFrom Information 1, we see that:\n- The gNB-CU sends RACH reports reported by the UE to the gNB-DU via F1AP signalling.\n- The gNB-DU is responsible for signaling the PRACH configuration per-cell back to the gNB-CU.\n- Additionally, the gNB-CU may forward a limited set of neighbor cell's PRACH configurations to the gNB-DU to assist in resolving configuration conflicts.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n1. The gNB-CU reassigns a new PCI for NR cells suffering PCI conflict. (This is related to PCI optimization, not RACH.)\n2. The gNB-DU reports RACH configuration conflict to the gNB-CU. (This seems plausible, but it's not directly stated.)\n3. The gNB-DU signals the PRACH configuration per-cell to the gNB-CU. (This is correct, as per the information provided.)\n4. The gNB-CU merges the outgoing RIM information received from its gNB-DUs. (This is not mentioned in relation to RACH configuration.)\n5.

        "response": "To determine the correct state in which the UE is expected to receive the DL PRS for RTT-based propagation delay compensation, we can analyze the provided information.\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The downlink PRS (Positioning Reference Signal) is used for RTT (Round Trip Time) based propagation delay compensation. For the UE to effectively measure and process this signal, it must be in a state where it is actively communicating with the network.\n\n2. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - **RRC_IDLE state**: In this state, the UE is not actively communicating with the network and would not be able to receive DL PRS.\n   - **RRC_CONNECTED state**: In this state, the UE is actively communicating with the network and is expected to receive DL PRS for RTT-based propagation delay compensation.\n   - **RRC_INACTIVE state**: This state is intermediate and may allow for some reception but is not primarily designed for active communication.\n   - **RRC_RELEASED state**: In this state, the UE has released its connection to the network and cannot receive any signals.\n   - **None of the above**: This option implies that none of the states are suitable, which we can disregard since RRC_CONNECTED state is suitable.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The correct state for the UE to receive the DL PRS for RTT-based propagation delay compensation is when it is in the RRC_CONNECTED state.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\ncorrect option: 2"
