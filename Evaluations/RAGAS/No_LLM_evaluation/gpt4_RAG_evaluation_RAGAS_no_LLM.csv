How are network nodes and NG-RAN configured with Disaster Condition? [3GPP Release 17],"to understand how network nodes and ngran are configured with disaster condition we can break down the process step by step based on the relevant information provided

1 understanding the context of disaster condition
    a disaster condition impacts the 3gpp access meaning that while one or more ran nodes of the plmn with disaster condition may be nonoperational other network functions can still be assumed operational
    the communication between plmns public land mobile networks with and without disaster conditions is critical for disaster roaming functionalities

2 configuration of ngran and amf
    when a disaster condition is identified the ngran node of a plmn without a disaster condition becomes a shared ran node with the plmn where the disaster condition applies this is crucial for maintaining connectivity for ues user equipments during emergencies
    ngran nodes need to perform an ng setup with an amf access and mobility management function of a different plmn however this connection should not be utilized until the amf notifies that a disaster condition applies this ensures that resources are used appropriately

3 notification and interpretation
    after the setup the ngran node must be capable of interpreting notifications in the ngap next generation application protocol that indicate a disaster condition applies or no longer applies this is critical for managing the state of the network and ensuring appropriate routing of ues

4 ue behavior and information removal
    ues need to be able to determine when a disaster condition applies either through 3gpp access or non3gpp access however the behavior of ues remains unchanged when they are out of coverage of the serving plmn and when the disaster condition does not apply
    once the ues detect that their previous serving plmn is available again they remove the stored information regarding the disaster condition

5 ran sharing implications
    in the case of ran sharing the shared ran node does not broadcast the same information that would have been communicated by the ngran node of the plmn with the disaster condition this limits certain features but allows for basic connectivity

based on this analysis the configuration of network nodes and ngran during a disaster condition involves establishing connections between amf and ngran nodes across different plmns managing notifications regarding the disaster condition and enabling shared ran functionalities while ensuring that ues.",based on operator policy and the request by government agencies.,,0.030690537084398978,0.0,0.0

    slpsfchrbset this parameter indicates the set of prbs that are used for psfch transmission a bitmap is used where a value of 1 indicates that the corresponding prb is used while a value of 0 indicates it is not used
    slpsfchtype this indicates the type of psfch for operation with shared spectrum channel access when slpsfchtype  type1 the allocation is determined based on the slpsfchrbset

3 allocation process
    the ue user equipment determines all prbs of an interlace for one psfch transmission with harqack information using the slpsfchrbset 
    for a given candidate psfch transmission occasion indexed by n the ue will determine a set of interlaces based on the slpsfchrbset
    the interlaces include a number of interlaces denoted as minterlacekpsfchn which indicates how many interlaces are available for the specific transmission occasion
    the allocation of the prbs follows an ascending order based on indices ensuring that they are efficiently utilized

4 mathematical representation
    the formula provided indicates that for a psfch slot and subchannel the ue calculates the number of subchannels and slots available for allocation the allocation process is dependent on several factors including the number of prbs subchannels and pssch slots

in summary the allocation of prbs for psfch transmission with harqack information is determined by the slpsfchrbset.",in an ascending order of both the prb index and the cyclic shift pair index.,,0.052980132450331126,0.0,0.0
