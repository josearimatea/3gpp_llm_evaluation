How is Extended Access Barring supported in shared networks? [3GPP Release 17],"to determine the answer we should look into the specifics of extended access barring eab in shared networks especially since we are referring to 3gpp release 17

information 3 explains the specifics of access class barring acb but it doesnt directly discuss shared networks information 4 discusses barring of access to specific dnnsapns in a general context and while it does mention packetoriented services and networks including the access network andor the core network it does not directly speak to shared networks either

however information 5 does discuss extended access barring eab and its override option in shared networks specifically

information 5 describes how eab functions for ues in shared networks according to it if theres an extension to eab ie an operator determined barring mechanism for packetoriented services shared network operators may handle eab configurations and overrides

since information 2 indirectly implies the possibility of implementing override rules in a shared setting for preventing overload on the network and information 5 further details those handling scenarios for eab combined these give a reason that support for eab could indeed function and interact with shared network settings as long as both can be configured within shared parameters this conclusion based upon relevant details that might exist at release 17 would allow extended access barring to potentially support with consideration of the shared nature.",the bscrncenodeb provides independent support for each sharing operator.,,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0

What does the timing advance command for a TAG indicate? [3GPP Release 17],"to answer this question well break down the relevant information provided and think step by step to arrive at the correct answer

 9431 max timing advance indicates that the maximum timing advance value is sent as part of a command this command is related to controlling the timing of a mobile station ms and involves setting or adjusting the timing advance value to suit the cells environment or specific requirements

 1212b packet extended timing advance shows the provision for extended timing advance support which could be necessary for bands like gsm 400 where specific adjustments are made to bits 7 and 8 of the timing advance value this implies the command might be extended to support more significant adjustments than typical timing advance values allow

 9324 timing advance provides a straightforward definition of the timing advance element specifying its identification and the field it contains this section indicates how timing advance is sent to the mobile station as part of a command from the base station bts

 9431 max timing advance and 9324 timing advance together suggest that this timing advance command might be related to adjustments or setting the timing advance value for a specific tagged area or group tag within the cells coverage area the max in the heading could imply a setting for maximum adjustments needed for that tag

 command indications a tag typically indicates specific parameters for different groups of subscribers adjusting the timing advance for a tag would likely mean the timing advance is set or adjusted for that group to align with specific requirements

answer this command indicates that the timing advance is being set for a specific tag tagged area or group which may require adjustments beyond typical timing advances for the cells entire coverage area its a way to control and finetune the timing to ensure compatibility and performance within specific subscriber groups.",change of uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing.,,0.03115264797507788,0.0,0.0

How is the modulation order (Qm) and target code rate (R) determined for PSSCH transmission? [3GPP Release 17],"to determine how the modulation order qm and target code rate r are determined for pssch transmission we need to analyze information 1

according to information 1 for pssch transmission the modulation and coding scheme is set to pssch mcs and set as the pssch mcs specified in the test

additionally the time gap between initial transmission and retransmission is 0 note 2

now referring to information 3 modulation order  the modulation order  used in the physical downlink shared channel is set to   
 otherwise the ue shall useand table 71711 to determine the
modulation order  used in the physical downlink shared channel

for the specific case of pssch since its a physical downlink shared channel we would look at table 71711 modulation and tbs index table for pdsch

however the table only provides information for pdsch not for pssch nonetheless for the pssch transmission  we need to use information 1 modulation and coding scheme and retransmission index the determination is carried out using imcs and table 61411 to determine the modulation order qm and target code rate r used in the physical uplink shared channel but since the specific case is pssch and  we have no information from that table and there is no specification of a method to use in information 4 thus the answer would bethe determination for pssch transmission depends on  using the imcs and the corresponding information about the  pssch  channel.",based on the mcs table.,,0.024999999999999998,0.0,0.0
