What does the Load-Balancing steering mode do? [3GPP Release 17],the loadbalancing steering mode introduced in 3gpp release 17 is a traffic steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow between the 3gpp and the non3gpp accesses the network typically provides predefined or fixed percentage splits such as 20 on the 3gpp access and 80 on the non3gpp access however in release 17 the network may also provide an autonomous loadbalance indicator allowing the user equipment ue and the user plane function upf to independently select their own percentage splits for each access type subject to link status measurements this allows for maximum throughput of a given data flow in both the uplink and downlink directions.,splits the traffic of a data flow across 3gpp and non3gpp accesses.,0.2,0.5905810368077341,4
