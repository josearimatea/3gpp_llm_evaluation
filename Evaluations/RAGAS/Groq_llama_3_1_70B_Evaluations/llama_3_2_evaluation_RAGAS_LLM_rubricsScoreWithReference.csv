How can UE power consumption due to false paging alarms be reduced? [3GPP Release 17],"UE power consumption can be reduced due to false paging alarms in 3GPP Release 17 through the implementation of Advanced Power Save Mode (APSM) and Enhanced Contiki power saving mechanism.

1. Advanced Power Save Mode (APSM) - APSM is a new power-saving mechanism that can be activated when a UE detects frequent or unneeded paging alarms. This mode limits power consumption by adjusting CPU performance, turning off certain radios, and other power-saving measures.

2. Enhanced Contiki power saving mechanism - This is a more advanced power-saving mechanism that uses advanced signal processing algorithms to reduce power consumption. It works by only waking up the CPU when needed and reducing CPU performance during sleep modes.

Additionally, the 3GPP Release 17 also provides other power management mechanisms to reduce false paging alarms such as:

- Power management policies implemented by the Network Management System (NMS) to reduce or limit unneeded paging.
- Optimization of cellular network parameters, such as transmission power, antenna selection and radio parameters, that can help minimize false alarms.
- Implementation of improved antenna configurations for better indoor and urban cellular coverage.",UE power consumption due to false paging alarms can be reduced by dividing UEs into multiple subgroups.,,0.6777818916107166,
