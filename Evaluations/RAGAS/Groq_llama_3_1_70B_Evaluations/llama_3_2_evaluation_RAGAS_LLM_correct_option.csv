How can UE power consumption due to false paging alarms be reduced? [3GPP Release 17],"ue power consumption can be reduced due to false paging alarms in 3gpp release 17 through the implementation of advanced power save mode apsm and enhanced contiki power saving mechanism

1 advanced power save mode apsm  apsm is a new powersaving mechanism that can be activated when a ue detects frequent or unneeded paging alarms this mode limits power consumption by adjusting cpu performance turning off certain radios and other powersaving measures

2 enhanced contiki power saving mechanism  this is a more advanced powersaving mechanism that uses advanced signal processing algorithms to reduce power consumption it works by only waking up the cpu when needed and reducing cpu performance during sleep modes

additionally the 3gpp release 17 also provides other power management mechanisms to reduce false paging alarms such as

 power management policies implemented by the network management system nms to reduce or limit unneeded paging
