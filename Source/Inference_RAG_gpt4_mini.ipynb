Information regarding the 3GPP AAA server behavior indicates that it reports its load using Load AVPs and factors such as traffic over various interfaces and internal resource usage.\\n2. Trusted non-3GPP access network behavior also mentions using Load AVPs to select Diameter agents based on load values.\\n3. The S6b interface mentions that the Diameter load control mechanism is optional and involves the 3GPP AAA server and the PDN-GW (Packet Data Network Gateway).\\n4. Information 4 and 5 mention the Load Control Information in the context of GTP-C signaling, indicating that it plays a role in load balancing across networks.\\n\\nGiven these insights, the NGAP procedure used for inter-system load balancing would likely involve the signaling mechanisms that utilize Load Control Information to manage the traffic across different systems, including both 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks.\\n\\nBased on the context provided and the absence of specific NGAP procedures detailed in the information supplied, I will conclude that the procedure related to load balancing involves the use of Load Control Information, which is part of the general signaling mechanisms in NGAP.\\n\\nFinal answer: answer: Load Control Information in NGAP signaling.'"
