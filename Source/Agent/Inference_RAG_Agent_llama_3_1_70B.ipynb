            "\n",
            "1. **Understanding the Issue**: False paging alarms refer to unnecessary paging events triggered by the network that result in the UE waking up to check for messages, only to find there are none. This process consumes power.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Potential Solutions**:\n",
            "   - **Target SSSG**: Switching to a target SSSG (Secondary Synchronization Signal Group) might not directly address the issue of false paging alarms, as SSSG is more related to synchronization and cell identification.\n",
            "   - **Reducing PDCCH Monitoring**: PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) monitoring is crucial for UEs to detect paging and control messages from the network. Reducing this monitoring could indeed minimize unnecessary wake-ups, directly addressing false paging alarms.\n",
            "   - **Relaxing UE Measurements**: Measurements for RLM (Radio Link Monitoring) and BFD (Blind Forward Detection) are related to link quality and detection of Forward Detection, respectively. Relaxing these might not directly address the false paging alarm issue.\n",
            "   - **Providing TRS/CSI-RS Occasions**: TRS (Tracking Reference Signal) and CSI-RS (Channel State Information Reference Signal) are related to cell detection and channel measurement. Providing these occasions might help in certain scenarios but may not directly reduce false paging alarms.\n",
            "   - **Dividing UEs into Subgroups**: This approach can potentially reduce the number of UEs paged at any given time, thereby reducing the likelihood of false paging alarms for individual UEs.\n",

            "First, let's consider what PSSCH (Physical Sidelink Shared Channel) is used for. PSSCH is a channel used in sidelink communications, which enables direct communication between user equipment (UE) without the need for a base station. This is particularly useful for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, smart grids, and other IoT applications.\n",

            "Given that PSSCH is involved in sidelink communications, the determination of its modulation and coding parameters might not follow the conventional methods used in downlink or uplink transmissions, which typically rely on tables (like MCS tables) or specific signaling from the base station.\n",

            "- Option 1 (Based on the DM-RS configuration): DM-RS (Demodulation Reference Signals) are indeed crucial for channel estimation in many 3GPP channels, but linking DM-RS configuration directly to modulation order and code rate determination for PSSCH seems less straightforward without additional context.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Option 2 (Based on the MCS table): MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) tables are commonly used in 3GPP to define the modulation and coding rates for various channels. However, for sidelink channels like PSSCH, the method of determining these parameters might differ due to the nature of sidelink communications.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Option 3 (Based on the number of REs in the slot): Resource Elements (REs) are the basic resource allocation units in 3GPP radio frames. While the number of REs can affect the capacity and potential transmission parameters, it's not typically used as a direct basis for determining modulation order and code rate for specific channels.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "- Option 5 (Based on the number of DMRS port): This option, though somewhat speculative without additional context, suggests a relationship between the number of DMRS ports and the determination of Qm and R.
